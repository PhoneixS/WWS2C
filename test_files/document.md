# Introduction
If you are a fan of both Dungeons & Dragons and Harry Potter, I present to you Wands & Wizards, a Harry Potter 5e Adaptation. Joining the magic of the Wizarding World with the gameplay of D&D 5e, this comprehensive Wizarding Alternative for Novelty Dungeoneering Stories (or W.A.N.D.S.) Rulebook substitutes 5e races, classes, subclasses, backgrounds, feats, skills, equipment, and spells. Like the 5e PHB, Part 1 of the W.A.N.D.S. Rulebook contains new character creation options. Part 2 focuses on the changes made to spellcasting and all of the new spells from the Harry Potter series. If you are unfamiliar with any of the Harry Potter references, please review the Glossary at the end of the W.A.N.D.S. Rulebook.

## Differences from 5e
While all the core mechanics and rules of D&D still apply, all the character creation options have been replaced. None of 5e's default character options are available in W&W: no races, classes, backgrounds, feats, or equipment are compatible (unless specifically noted, like a handful of feats). The process of character creation remains unchanged, so you need only progress through the W.A.N.D.S. Rulebook sequentially, just like you would with the PHB. Below is a table that converts the 5e terminology into W&W terminology.

<div class='classTable' style="margin-top:50px;">

##### Character Creation Conversion Table
| 5e                 | W&W             |
|:------------------:|:---------------:|
| Race               | House           |
| Class              | Casting Style   |
| Subclass or Archetype | School of Magic |
| Background         | Wand or Background |
</div>

Aside from character creation, there have been a few other changes to the system. Firstly, some skills have been added, removed, or replaced to better represent the skills used in the wizarding word. The skill conversion table can be found on page 40, which outlines how old 5e skills correspond with W&W skills. These are not simply renamings; new W&W skills can have different definitions and applications. 

Most importantly, you will not be using the normal 5e spell lists. You will only use the spells in this rulebook, but quite a few 5e spells have been renamed or slightly modified. If a 5e spell has been included in W&W, it will be shown in the spell conversion tables on pages 45 and 46.

\columnbreak
### A Harry Potter Spellcaster
For character classes, you'll see three different casting styles. Although these represent three different classes, all three are built on the chassis of the 5e Sorcerer. Additionally, because they're all the same class at their core, they all have the same spell list. In W&W, everyone has access to the same spells (with some clear exceptions).
### The Role of the HM
HM stands for Headmaster or Headmistress, which is used specifically to represent the Game Master running the game of W&W. That abbreviation is used throughout the document to refer to this person, whereas the term "headmaster" will mean the head professor of Hogwarts.
## Levels and Hogwarts Years
A characterâs early levels can be associated with the magical abilities acquired through different years of school. Levels 1-2 correspond to average first-year students, just being introduced to schools of magic. Level 3 is second year and level 4 is third year, and at this point, they have learned to exercise some control over their magic. The threats they face are relatively minor, usually only posing a danger to other children or small villages. 

Level 5 will typically be covered in the fourth year. Fifth-year students are levels 6-7, while sixth-year students are levels 8-9. This is when young witches and wizards really come into their own, learning powerful spells and abilities from their school of magic and becoming capable of facing dangers that threaten adult wizards. 

Seventh year students are level 10 while Hogwarts graduates and the majority of adult wizards are levels 11-12. Only well-practiced wizards reach levels 13-16, like Aurors, Hogwarts teachers and members of the Order of the Phoenix (back in the Second Wizarding War). These characters have reached a level of power that makes them special even among wizards, confronting threats to whole regions or wizard academies. 

At levels 17-20, characters achieve the pinnacle of their school of magicâs features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of magical governments or even the entire muggle world might hang in the balance during their adventures.

# Chapter 1: Houses (Races)
Hogwarts students are divided up into four houses by the Sorting Hat when they first arrive at Hogwarts. Houses at Hogwarts are both the living and learning communities for its students. Each year's group of students in the same house shares their dormitory and many classes, acting as a sort of family. The houses compete by earning points for the House Cup and playing for the Inter-House Quidditch Cup.

Each house has stereotypical traits that are grounded in reality, but students are quite diverse. Some young witches and wizards share traits with another house, like Hermione Granger's Ravenclaw-like brilliance. Others might appear the exact opposite of their house, like Neville Longbottom's lack of confidence (needing time to grow into bravery) or Luna Lovegood's ostensible disconnection from facts (keeping a creative, open mind and being perceptive). The Sorting Hat places students in the house that will benefit them the most.

The way you decide your character's house is not always by what they do, but what would make them proudest if they were strong enough to do it. Your sorting is what you want to be and what you believe in.

<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/b/b1/Gryffindor_ClearBG.png/revision/latest?cb=20190222162949" style="width:200px; margin: -12px -20px -30px 0; float:right;" />

## Gryffindor
With a lion as its crest, Gryffindor is the house which most values the virtues of determination, courage, and chivalry. Some call these traits recklessness or "pointless heroics," but a Gryffindor is sure to take action. Gryffindor's house colors are red and gold.
### Champions of Justice
Gryffindors trust their moral intuitions and have a need and a drive to live by them. They feel whatâs right in their gut, and that matters and guides them. It feels immoral to ignore that.

However, just because they operate on what âfeels right,â that doesnât mean Gryffindors are all impetuous, emotional hellions. Gryffindors can still be intelligent and deliberate, weighing their decisions and moralities carefully.
### Fighting Spirit
Gryffindors charge. They meet the world head-on and challenge it to do its worst. Gryffindors are honest, brash, and bold in pursuit of things they care about. Known for their bravery, it is almost a moral matter to stay true to themselves in any situation.
### Gryffindor Traits
Through their camaraderie, Gryffindors bolster each other's confidence and endeavors.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score, Charisma score, and one other ability score of choice increase by 1.

**Bravehearted.** You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened from any source other than a Dementor.

**True Gryffindor.** In times of dire need, the Sword of Gryffindor may present itself to you.

**Feat.** You gain one feat of your choice.

<img src="https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/0/06/Hufflepuff_ClearBG.png/revision/latest?cb=20161020182518" style="width:200px; margin: -10px -50px 0px 10px; float:right;" />

## Hufflepuff
Hufflepuffs value hard work, patience, loyalty, and fair play, represented by the sturdy badger. Although often disparaged by others for their lack of competitiveness, the house has produced great wizards â not least Newt Scamander, notable magizoologist and author. Hufflepuff's house colors are yellow and black.
### Compassion and Empathy
Hufflepuffs value people and community. They base their decisions on who is in need and who they can help. They value fairness because everyone is a person. Even directly wronged, Hufflepuffs will often give a second (or fifth) chance.

But Hufflepuffs aren't inherently tolerant, like Gryffindors aren't inherently moral. They believe that all people deserve some type of kindness or decency, but they can redefine "person" to exclude anyone who doesn't meet their standards.
### Hard Workers
Hufflepuffs toil. Their strength comes from consistency and the integrity of their method. They have a certain steadiness, naturally becoming the lynchpin of a community. While stereotyped as being social, a Hufflepuff might also be an introverted misanthrope who runs on hard work alone.
### Hufflepuff Traits
You can rely on them to have certain attributes in common.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Constitution score, Wisdom score, and one other ability score of choice increase by 1.

**Steadfast Loyalty.** You have advantage on saving throws against any effect that would make you attack or work against a creature you would normally consider an ally.


**Kitchen Trips.** Your experience with the Hogwarts house elves has taught you how to politely address and interact with magical beings. Oh, and you can get tons of snacks.

**Feat.** You gain one feat of your choice.

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/7/71/Ravenclaw_ClearBG.png" style="width:200px; margin: 0px -20px 0px -35px; float:left;" />

## Â Â Â Â Ravenclaw
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ravenclaws prize wit, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â learning, and wisdom. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It's an ethos etched into Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â founder Rowena Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ravenclaw's diadem: 'wit Â Â Â Â Â Â beyond measure is man's Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â greatest treasure.' Despite Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the house's reputation for Â Â Â Â Â eccentricity and reclusiveness, Â Â Â Ravenclaws tend to make their Â mark on the world. Ravenclaw's house colors are blue and bronze.
### A Systematic Mind
Ravenclaws construct systems to test their decisions against before they feel comfortable calling something right. Their systems give them a way to frame the world and a confidence in their ability to interact with it.

Ravenclaws do not lack intuition, but often distrust gut instinct. Although they go about it differently, a Ravenclaw can be just as morally motivated as a Gryffindor.
### Contingency Planners
Ravenclaws plan. They collect information, they strategize. They have tools. They run hypotheticals and try to plan ahead for things that might come up. They build things (of varying degrees of actual usefulness) that they can use later, whether thatâs an emergency supply pack or vast knowledge in a niche topic. They feel less at home in improvisation and more comfortable taking the time to be prepared.

### Ravenclaw Traits
With a library in their common room, Ravenclaws will always share studious habits.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score, Wisdom score, and one other ability score of choice increase by 1.

**In-Depth Knowledge.** Whenever you make an Intelligence or Wisdom ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 5 or lower as a 6.

**Rowena's Library.** You can easily research a desired topic through enlisting your housemates' help and browsing books exclusively found in the Ravenclaw common room.

**Feat.** You gain one feat of your choice.

## Slytherin
Slytherin produces more than its share of Dark wizards, but also turns out leaders who are proud, ambitious, resourceful, and cunning. Merlin is one particularly famous Slytherin. What others may call cheating or manipulation, a Slytherin calls "playing the game." Slytherin's house colors are green and silver.
### Inner Circle
Slytherins are fiercely loyal to the people they care for most. Slytherin is the place where "youâll make your real friends"; they prioritize individual loyalties and find their moral core in protecting and caring for the people they are closest to.

Slytherinâs reputation for ambition comes from prioritizing themselves and the select people they deem important. Ambition is something you can find in all four houses, but Slytherinâs looks most obviously selfish.
### Machiavellian Maneuvers

Slytherins improvise.

## Beauxbatons
Located in the mountains of France, the AcadÃ©mie de Magie BeauxbÃ¢tons or Beauxbatons Academy of Magic is Â Â Â Â Â Â the choice of magical education Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â for young witches and wizards Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â living in Western, Southern, Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â and sometimes even Central Â Â Â Â Â Â Europe. For wizards in the UK, Â Â Â Â Beauxbatons is most notable for its Â Â friendly rivalry to Hogwarts, and the Â Â Â Â Â Â two schools have often supported Â Â Â Â Â Â Â each other throughout history. Â Â Â Â Â Â Beauxbatons is widely recognized Â Â Â for the elegance of its castle, its majestic gardens and its well-prepared cuisine.
### Tradition and Discipline
Etiquette and respect are at the forefront of Beauxbatons customs. The students stand at attention whenever their headmaster or headmistress enters a room and continue doing so until they take a seat or order everyone to return to their tasks.

There is a strong atmosphere of school pride, and the Academy's traditions are treasured by staff and students alike. While taught to be polite, that pride often shows through when students of Beauxbatons travel abroad.
### A Delicate Approach to Magic
Beauxbatons Academy of Magic teaches its students to approach magic with control and finesse, instead of clumsiness or brute force. The studies revolve around proper dueling forms, taxonomies and knowledge deeply grounded in magical theory.

To an untrained eye, the deliberate movements of Beauxbatons duelists might resemble a choreographed dance, but it's closer to the precision, quickness and lethality of Muggle fencing.
### Beauxbatons Student Traits
The traits of Beauxbatons students originate from their school's dueling style and from their travels abroad.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Dexterity score, Wisdom score, and one other ability score of choice increase by 1.

**Nimble Evasion.** Whenever you take the dodge action, add half your proficiency bonus to your AC and your Dexterity saving throws.

**Exchange Student.** You're familiar with the workings of the International Confederation of Wizards and other international associations.

**Feat.** You gain one feat of your choice.

## Durmstrang
Even among the magical community, the Durmstang Institute's location is a closely guarded secret, a symptom of the magical school's distrust of outsiders. Some believe it to be somewhere in the Nordic countries or Russia, but the only thing that's certain is that it accepts students from Northern, Central and Eastern European countries. Historically, Durmstrang has also refused to accept Muggleborn students, although that might be attributed to a previous headmaster's association with Britain's Death Eaters. Its modern policies are unknown.
### Unorthodox Curriculum
Durmstrang is notorious for its acceptance of the Dark Arts, and was known to have educated (and later expelled) Gellert Grindelwald before his ascension as one of history's most dangerous Dark wizards. 

Contrary to its reputation, Durmstrang doesn't specialize in the Dark Arts themselves, but in combative magic. The school is simply open-minded about the use of Dark Arts, and so most topics studied at Durmstrang incorporate Dark elements other schools would forswear.
### Strength Through Hardship
The stern and militaristic culture that has pervaded the Durmstrang Institute is mirrored in its harsh surroundings. Brutal winters, rigorous physical exercise regimens and swimming in ice cold lakes are all part of the character-building school experience.

Although some parents feel the approach is too extreme, everything is designed to produce resilient and resourceful wizards and witches who will survive any combat.
### Durmstrang Student Traits
The Durmstrang coursework and philosophy strongly define its students' attributes.

## Horned Serpent (Ilvermorny)
Horned Serpent is the house of scholars. Isolt Sayre, the founder of Ilvermorny, named her house for her friendship with a horned serpent and her ability to understand Parseltongue. Horned Serpent represents the mind of the wizard, since Isolt's passion for learning has been preserved in Horned Serpent.
### Natural Academics
Because of Horned Serpent's reputation for studiousness, parallels are often drawn with the Ravenclaw house at Hogwarts, but Hogwarts and Ilvermorny houses are not equivalent to each other. 

While it would be common to find a Horned Serpent student at the top of their class, you're just as likely to find them heading out to obtain first-hand practical experience. A certain appreciation of nature is another notable trait of Horned Serpent.
### Horned Serpent Traits
Horned Serpents consistently like to test their well-rounded intellect.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Intelligence score, Charisma score, and one other ability score of choice increase by 1.

**Scholar's Mind.** You add half your proficiency bonus to any Intelligence or Wisdom ability check you make that doesn't already include your proficiency bonus.

**Feat.** You gain one feat </br>of your choice.

<img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/harrypotter/images/e/e6/Wampus_ClearBG_2.png" style="width:220px; margin: -35px -60px 0px -50px;float:right;" />

## Wampus (Ilvermorny)
The house represents the </br>body of the wizard. Wampus</br> was chosen by Webster Boot, </br>one of the first students of </br>Ilvermorny and one of Isolt </br>Sayre's adopted children. </br>Wampus favors warriors, taking after Webster's career in the British colonies as a prominent "Auror for hire."
### Warriors at Heart
Wampus is named after the wampus cat, an extremely dangerous magical creature found in America. The wampus cat is XXXXX classified by the Ministry of Magic: "Known wizard killer / impossible to train or domesticate," which is fitting for the Ilvermorny house's reputation.

Wampuses rarely back down from a fight, whether it's in the form of an argument, fisticuffs or exchanged hexes. They place great value on swift action and self-defense. Fiercely loyal too, a Wampus is a good person to have on your side and terrible to have against you.

**Contagious Valor.** Your moxie can be inspiring, and those around you feel more inclined to accompany you into battle against your foes.

**Feat.** You gain one feat of your choice.

## Thunderbird (Ilvermorny)
Thunderbird is said to represent the soul of the wizard and is home to adventurers. The house was named and created by Chadwick Boot, Webster Boot's older brother, Isolt Sayre's other adopted son, and one of the first students of Ilvermorny. The Thunderbird house has been associated with Chadwick's later accomplishments as an international traveller and author of magical textbooks.
### Discovery and Creation
The house is named after the awe-inspiring thunderbird, whose natural habitat is in southwestern United States. Thanks to its ability to create storms and its wide-ranging travels around North America, it's the most widely known magical creatures among indigenous No-Maj communities. Thunderbird students similarly feel a yearning to venture beyond the ordinary. 

That desire can be expressed <br/>through literal or conceptual <br/>exploration, as Thunderbirds <br/>are just as likely to <br/>forge new paths in <br/>their chosen field as <br/>forge new paths through <br/>the untamed wilderness. <br/>Wherever they go, they'll <br/>go boldy.

**Adventurer's Footing.** Moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement.

**Dependable Bearings.** You have a good sense of direction and can easily use notable landmarks and geography to remember the general layout of areas. 

**Feat.** You gain one feat of your choice.

## Pukwudgie (Ilvermorny)
The Pukwudgie house <br/>represents the heart of the <br/>wizard, and is commonly <br/>associated with healers. <br/>This house was named by <br/>James Steward, famous <br/>for being the co-founder of Ilvermorny, husband of Isolt <br/>Sayre, adoptive father of Chadwick and Webster Boot and the only known no-maj wandmaker.
### Supportive and Self-Sufficient
James chose this house because a pukwudgie named William had accompanied Isolt. A mix between European goblins and house-elves in both appearance and magical capabilities, pukwudgies are traditionally aloof from human-kind. William later saved the lives of Isolt, James, and the Boots, and because of the respect showed by James, William and his descendants became Ilvermorny's guards and caretakers.

Students of the Pukwudgie house are often quite caring and compassionate. They easily empathize, even with an enemy, and enjoy seeing others achieve their goals. However, Pukwudgies are just as capable of taking care of themselves and won't forget to prioritize their own happiness.
### Pukwudgie Traits
Pukwudgies' perspective gives them common attributes.

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Wisdom score, Charisma Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â score, and one other ability score of choice increase by 1.

# Chapter 2: Casting Styles (Classes)
While any wizard can cast a wide variety of spells, a young wizard's approach to magic defines his own unique casting style. Casting styles separate wizards and affect how they learn and use magic. The three available casting styles to choose from are Willpower, Technique, and Intellect. A wizard can only have one casting style and cannot multiclass or gain levels in any other casting styles.

Casting styles are the wizarding equivalent of classes. Casting style determines a character's Hit Dice, spellcasting ability score, saving throw proficiencies, and two skills. Although all wizards and witches are based what a Muggle would call a Sorcerer, each casting style will have slightly different class features, number of spells known, sorcery points, and metamagic progression.
<div class='classTable wide' style='margin:50px 0px 50px;'>

| Casting Style | <span style="color:white;">__</span> | Description | Hit Die | Primary Ability | Saving Throws | Skill Proficiency Options |
|:-------------:|:-| :------------|:-------:|:---------------:|:-------------------------:|:--------------------------|
| Willpower     | | An inspirational survivor, who </br>has a heart of a warrior | d10 | CHA          | CON </br>& CHA                 | Athletics, Deception, </br>Intimidation, Magical Theory, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand, Survival |
| Technique     | | A powerful specialist, with immense control over spells | d6 | WIS           | INT </br>& WIS | Acrobatics, Herbology, Insight, Perception, </br>Potion-Making, Sleight of Hand, Stealth |
| Intellect     | | A versatile academic, with a solution for every problem | d8 | INT           | DEX </br>& INT|                 Acrobatics, Herbology, Insight, Investigation, </br>Magical Creatures, Magical Theory, Medicine, Muggle Studies and Survival |
</div>

Similarly, a witch's interests and background will lead her to specialize in a particular school of magic (Chapter 3). Studying a school of magic grants special abilities and knowledge related to that favored branch of magic, typically connecting to a future wizarding profession. A witch can only have one school of magic and cannot gain levels in any other school of magic. Schools of magic are the wizarding equivalent of subclasses, but schools of magic are not restricted to certain casting styles.

A wizard of any casting style can study any school of magic, but some combinations will synergize particularly well. Each school of magic will have its own subclass features and some schools of magic have a list of spells â its school of magic spells â that you learn once you gain a spell slot of the level noted in the school of magic description. Once you gain a school of magic spell, it's added to your spells known, it doesnât count against your number of spells known, and it cannot be forgotten to learn another spell.

<div class='classTable wide' style='margin:30px 0px;'>

| School of Magic | Description | Suggested Class |
|:---------------:|:------------|:---------------:|
| Charms          | A non-lethal dueling master casting a spell for</br>every situation and enchanting artifacts | Technique or Intellect |
| Jinxes, Hexes, and Curses | A combatant going toe-to-toe with Dark wizards</br>and nullifying ancient curses and harmful magic | Willpower |
| Transfiguration | An innovator manipulating the elements or</br>shapeshifting into an animal form | Technique |
| Healing         | A skilled professional saving lives through the</br>treatment of magical ailments and injuries | Willpower or Intellect |
| Divination      | A mystic unraveling visions of the future or</br>probing minds for the answers they seek | Willpower or Technique |
| Magizoology     | A researcher bonding with fearsome beasts and</br>facing off with dark creatures | Intellect |

## Base Sorcerer Features
### Font of Magic
#### Sorcery Points
You can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for your level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a long rest.
#### Flexible Casting
You can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or sacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points.

**Creating Spell Slots.** You can transform unexpended sorcery points into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The created spell slots vanish at the end of a long rest.

| Slot Level | SP Cost | | Slot Level | SP Cost |
|:---:|:-:|:-:|:---:|:-:|
| 1st | 2 |   | 4th | 6 |
| 2nd | 3 |   | 5th | 7 |
| 3rd | 5 |

**Converting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points.** As a bonus action on your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of sorcery points equal to the slot's level.

### Metamagic
You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.
#### Careful Spell
When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spellâs full force. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of those creatures up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of one creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving throw.
#### Distant Spell
When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double the spell's range.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1 sorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.
#### Empowered Spell
When you roll a spell's damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to reroll a number of damage dice up to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum one). You must use the new rolls.

You can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a different Metamagic option during the spell's casting.
#### Extended Spell
When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you can spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum duration of 24 hours.

\columnbreak

#### Heightened Spell
When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made against the spell.
#### Quickened Spell
When you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 Bonus Action for this casting.
#### Subtle Spell
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it without any somatic or verbal Components.
#### Twinned Spell
When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesnât have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal to the spellâs level to target a second creature in range with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).

# The Willpower </br>Caster

When witches and wizards cast with feeling, they put all of their energy into their spells. Their âgut instinctâ approach to magic taps into that willpower, but teaches them to take shortcuts. These wizards often have strong personalities and gravitate to the frontlines.
## Class Features
As a Willpower caster, you gain the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per Willpower level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per Willpower level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Saving Throws:** Constitution, Charisma
- **Skills:** Choose two from Athletics, Deception, Intimidation, Magical Theory, Persuasion, Sleight of Hand and Survival
#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: a wand, a student's pack, a winter cloak, and a magical pet of your choice.
#### Spellcasting
Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

You must use a wand as a spellcasting focus for your spells. Your spell slot progression is the standard for full casters.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose two of the cantrips or spells you know and replace them with two new cantrips or spells, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### Sorcerous Resilience
The accidental magic in your early childhood never stopped protecting you. Your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.
#### Font of Magic, Metamagic, and Ability Score Improvement
Unless differences are shown in the Willpower class table, a Willpower caster has all Font of Magic, Sorcery Points, Flexible Casting, Metamagic, and Ability Score Improvement class features from a 5e Sorcerer.
#### Metamagic: Fierce Spell
At 3rd level, when you cast a spell, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast that spell as if it were cast using a spell slot one level higher than its original level, or 4 sorcery points to cast that spell two levels higher. The spell's higher level cannot

exceed your highest available level of spell slots. This does not count against your number of Metamagic options.
#### Metamagic: Resistant Spell
At 3rd level, when you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point per increased level to make your spell be treated by spell deflection, *finite incantatem*, or *reparifors* as if your spell was cast using a spell slot higher than its original level, making your spell more resistant. The spell's higher level cannot exceed your highest available level of spell slots. This does not count against your number of Metamagic options.
#### Apparition Lessons
When you reach 9th level, you gain the Apparition ability.
#### Signature Spells
When you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two of your known 3rd-level spells as your signature spells. You can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you canât do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
### Schools of Magic
Choose from the available Schools of Magic found in Chapter 3 to determine your subclass. You have access to the full spell list and can learn spells of any school of magic, except where signified with an asterisk in the Spell List in Chapter 9.

# The Intellect Caster
Clever wizards delve into the underlying theory of magic. These academics are able to learn a wide variety of spells, although they might struggle in the heat of battle. Their expertise and magical versatility makes them invaluable companions across the wizarding world.
## Class Features
As an Intellect caster, you gain the following class features.
#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d8 per Intellect level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 8 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d8 (or 5) + your Constitution modifier per Intellect level after 1st

#### Proficiencies
___
- **Saving Throws:** Dexterity, Intelligence
- **Skills:** Choose two from Acrobatics, Herbology, Insight, Investigation, Magical Creatures, Magical Theory, Medicine, Muggle Studies and Survival
#### Equipment
You start with the following equipment, in addition to the equipment granted by your background: a wand, a student's pack, a winter cloak, and a magical pet of your choice.
#### Spellcasting
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

You must use a wand as a spellcasting focus for your spells. Your spell slot progression is the standard for full casters (22 slots at level 20).

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose two of the cantrips or spells you know and replace them with two new cantrips or spells, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
#### Ritual Casting
Your ability to recall information allows you to freely cast spells, as long as you have enough time to stop and focus. At 1st level, you can cast a spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you know the spell. A ritual version of a spell takes only 1 minute longer to cast than normal. It also doesn't expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can't be cast at a higher level.

# Chapter 3: Schools of Magic (Subclasses)
## Charms
Charms, a type of spell that alters properties of a thing, can be some of the most powerful spells in existence. The Fidelius Charm, for example, can completely hide a person or a place in such a way that no one can find them unless given the Secret. Memory Charms can be so strong as to remove a person's memory or damage their mind permanently.
### Duelists
Many charms have been weaponized for magical combat. A wizard's duel is a formal practice in wizarding culture in which wizards or witches faced each other and, at the count of three, attempted to disarm, stun, injure, defeat, or kill each other in order to force submission. A duelist is a master of this art, competing in organized, refereed, and non-lethal duels to test and hone their skills.
### Enchanters
Other wizards try their hand at enchantments, a nearly permanent charm placed on an inanimate object. These bewitched objects can range from handy (like a self-stirring coffee mug), to complex (like a top-tier racing broom), to bizarre (like a book acting like a rabid version of its subject matter). An enchanted or bewitched object can be powerful in the hands of the right wizard.
##### School of Magic Spells
| Spell Level  | Spell |
|:------------:|:------|
|  2nd         | *muffliato* |
|  4th         | *capacious extremis* |
|  5th         | *obliviate*, *piertotum locomotor* |
___
### Subclass Features
#### Bewitching Studies
At 1st level, you gain one of the following features.

**Called Shot.** You've honed your aim to be able to strike very specifically with your dueling Charms. When casting a Charm, you can target specific items or body parts, as well as restrict the effects of the charm to only that specific item or body part.

**Protective Enchantments.** Any charm spell you cast that affects an area (cube, line, sphere, or cone) has its area's size doubled.
___
#### Advanced Charmswork
At 6th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Target Practice.** Your steady hand and hours of practice have given you an edge. Whenever you add your spellcasting ability modifier to a spell attack roll, add half your Dexterity modifier (rounded up) as a bonus as well.

**Professional Charmer.** You've learned to weave your enchantments throughout objects. If you cast a single target Charm with a duration longer than Instantaneous on an individual object, the effects have a permanent duration, if desired, until dispelled by you. This feature does not remove Concentration or Dedication requirements.
___
#### Unique Talents
At 10th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Muggle Dueling.** You've trained in non-magical dueling as a last-ditch effort. Add your proficiency bonus to your damage rolls for unarmed strikes and to any Strength checks involved with grappling or disarming a wizard.

**Obliviator.** Instead of simply erasing memories, when you cast *oblivate*, you can choose to implant very detailed false memories. These memories are undetectable by the target of the spell, but if others examine the target's memories (through Legilimency or a Penseive), they might be able to detect that they're false.
___
#### Refined Techniques
At 14th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Wand and Shield.** You've uncovered an ancient dueling style, allowing both offense and defense at the same time. When you cast *protego* or *protego maxima*, you can transition the spell's casting to your off-hand, freeing up your wand to cast other spells. The spell's dedication now expends a bonus action instead of an action, and you are able to cast and maintain another concentration or dedication spell with your wand. Any factor that affects maintaining concentration is applied individually to each effect (e.g. upon taking damage make a Constitution saving throw for each spell).

**A Duty to Protect.** When you cast *piertotum locomotor*, concentration is no longer required, twice as many objects can be animated, and the duration is extended to 1 hour.
___
#### Pinnacle of Casting
At 18th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Lightning-Fast Wand.** You've honed your skills in the dueling ring to be able to cast spells twice as fast as the average wizard. If you don't already have it, Quickened Spell is added to your metamagic options and does not count towards your metamagic count. When you use the Quickened Spell metamagic to cast a spell as a bonus action, you are able to cast any spell as your action and the normal bonus action spellcasting rules do not apply.

**Secret-Keeper.** You add the *fidelius mysteria celare* spell to your list of known spells. It does not count against your number of spells known, and cannot be forgotten to learn another spell.

## Jinxes, Hexes, and Curses
Formally referred to as Dark charms, jinxes, hexes and curses are often associated with the Dark Arts because they inflict malicious effects on the target. While jinxes are mostly irritating and hexes are a little worse or more painful, curses are the worst kind of Dark magic. All three Unforgivables are classified as curses, and the average civilian wizard could go their whole life without casting a serious curse.
### Aurors
Curses are mainstays in the arsenals of Aurors, highly-trained specialist officers tasked with upholding the law and protecting their magical communities from large-scale threats. To be successful, an Auror must be capable across a variety of skills, like curses, counter-spells, transfiguration, poisons, antidotes, concealment, disguise, and tracking.
### Curse-Breakers
On the other end of the spectrum, a curse-breaker removes, counters or breaks curses placed on objects or places for a living. Whilst curse-breakers could work for the Ministry of Magic, the term is also used to denote a number of adventurous bankers employed by Gringotts Wizarding Bank, tasked with disabling and countering curses in ancient tombs or historical sites to bring back gold and treasure.

___
### Subclass Features
#### Practical Studies
At 1st level, you gain one of the following features.

**Auror Training.** You've already started practicing the required skills to become an Auror. You learn one common potion recipe and gain proficiency in two of the following: Investigation, Potion-Making, Stealth, Survival.

\columnbreak

**Curse-Breaking.** Your curiosity in taking apart spells and enchantments has found an outlet. Gain a set of Curse-breakers' Tools and gain proficiency in Curse-breakers' Tools.
___
#### Combat-Ready
At 6th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Forceful Magic.** You cast every spell as if it were life-or-death. When you cast a spell that deals damage, add 1d6 to one damage roll.

**Magical Adrenaline.** Your magic invigorates you in times of dire need. As a bonus action, you can spend one hit die to recover hit points as you normally would after a short rest, equal to hit die + Constitution modifier. You have a number of uses equal to your proficiency bonus, and all uses are restored after a long rest.
___
#### Specialized Skills
At 10th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Dark Traces.** You've learned the patterns and styles of Dark magic. You have advantage on any Investigation, Insight, or Perception roll that is involved with detecting Dark magic or a Dark wizard. 

**Ward-Breaker.** *Curse-Breaking required.* It is impossible for anyone to magically detect the act of you successfully breaking a curse, removing an enchantment, or taking down a ward. If someone sees you curse-breaking or is actively looking for the removed magic, they will notice the magic's absence. If a spell is designed to notify the caster in some way, it no longer works and the caster will not be notified.
___
#### Cursemaster
At 14th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Dark Duelist.** Your experience fighting Dark wizards has taught you how to use their own techniques against them. You have advantage on any saving throws made against Dark spells, and any Dark spells you cast are automatically cast one level higher than the consumed spell slot, not exceeding the highest available level of spell slots you have.

**Defensive Arts.** You've learned how to block the most dangerous of spells. Defensive spells are automatically cast two levels higher than the consumed spell slot, not exceeding the highest available level of spell slots you have.
___
#### Legendary
At 18th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Auror Alert.** As a prominent combatant of Dark magic, you have connections in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. You can call in a two-man auror team to apparate in on your location. You canât use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

**Unravelling Magic.** Automatically succeed whenever casting *finite incantatem*.

**Fractured Soul.** Your pursuit of Dark magic has uncovered the writings of Herpo the Foul. You can create a Horcrux by performing the Horcrux Ritual, committing murder, and selecting a target to become the Horcrux. Only one Horcux may exist at one time.
<div class='footnote'>Part 1 | Schools of Magic (Subclasses)</div>

\pagebreakNum
## Transfiguration
Transfiguration is a branch of magic that focuses on the alteration of the form or appearance of an object, via the manipulation of the object's molecular structure. Transfiguration is regarded as âvery hard workâ and is âmore scientificâ than any other form of magic, i.e. the practicing witch or wizard has to get it exactly right for the transfiguration to be successful.
### Animagi
The most legendary practitioner of transfiguration is an Animagus, a witch or wizard who can self-transfigure into an animal at will. It takes skill, practice, and patience for wizards and witches to become Animagi. The process is long and arduous, and has the potential to backfire and cause the transformation to go horribly wrong. As a result, there are very few Animagi, and the power they possess requires registration with the Ministry of Magic.
### Alchemists

<img src='https://www.gmbinder.com/images/xsse1yI.png' style='margin: 10px -40px 0px 0; transform:rotate(-10deg); float:right;'>

A far less known application of transfiguration is Alchemy, the branch of magic and an ancient science concerned with the study of the structure, composition, and magical properties of the four basic elements (earth, air, fire, and water), as well as the transmutation of substances. Intimately connected with potion-making, chemistry and transfiguration, there are many who hold it to be the most difficult magic.

|  3rd         | *ignis laqueis* |
|  4th         | *lapifors* |
___
### Subclass Features
#### Scientific Studies
At 1st level, you gain one of the following features.

**Anatomy Textbook.** Your knowledge of the inner workings of a creature make your transfigurations easier. If a Transfiguration spell must be cast at a higher level to involve a living creature, you can involve a living creature and consume a spell slot one level lower than what's required.

**Intuitive Conversion.** Conceptualizing a transfiguration just comes easily to you. When you cast *vera verto*, it automatically affects targets one size larger than specified by the spell slot level.

\columnbreak
#### Transfiguration Prodigy
At 6th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Animagus Transformation.** You can use your action to magically assume the shape of your animagus form (see *Your Animagus Form* below). You can use this feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or long rest. 

**Elementalist.** Your study of Alchemy has given you insights in the nature of elements. Any spell that involves only fire, water, earth, or air is automatically cast one level higher than the consumed spell slot, not exceeding the highest available level of spell slots you have.
___
#### Precise Control
At 10th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Partial Transfiguration.** Your understanding of magical theory has enabled you to compartmentalize your magic. Any transfiguration spell can be intentionally cast as a partial transfiguration, converting only the desired portion of the target. All the same capabilities and restrictions of casting those spells at higher levels apply.

**Molding the Elements.** You've learned to bend the elements to your will. Any spell that involves only fire, water, earth, or air can be cast in a different shape than the original spell intended. The new shape cannot exceed the approximate area or volume of the original spell.
___
#### Magically Reinforced
At 14th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Durable Constructs.** You imbue your constructs of creatures with a more potent magic. Your transfigured or conjured living constructs gain additional hit points equal to your level and deal an additional 1d6 of damage.

**Fortified Structures.** You've learned to make magical objects stronger than the real thing. Your transfigured or conjured objects have twice as many hit points before breaking, and can support three times as much weight as their mundane equivalents.
___
#### Molecular Manipulator
At 18th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Apex Predator.** *Animagus Transformation required.* You've achieved complete mastery over the mystical art of animagus transformations. You can transform on your turn as a bonus action, instead of an action Additionally, you can select two additional creatures as your animagus shapes, and you can choose to keep these shapes hidden from the Ministry of Magic. You may also choose to use any of these animals as your corporeal patronus.

**True Alchemist.** Your lifelong study of Flamel's and Dumbledore's writings has finally come to fruition. You can create a Philosopherâs Stone, turning any metal into gold and producing the Elixir of Life. You cannot die of natural causes, and you age at a slower rate. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages only 1 year. Only one Philosopherâs Stone may exist at one time.
<div class='footnote'>Part 1 | Schools of Magic (Subclasses)</div>

\pagebreakNum
### Your Animagus Form
You can stay in animagus form for a number of hours equal to half your transfiguration level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points, or die.

While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
* Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast, but you retain your alignment, personality, and intelligence, wisdom, and charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you, use the higher bonus.
* When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and hit dice. When you revert, you return to the hit points you had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animagus form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage.
* You can't cast spells, and the actions you can take are dependent on your beast form's physical capabilities. Transforming doesn't break your concentration or prevent actions that are part of an already-cast spell, but Dedication spells end upon transforming.

* You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or other source and can use them if the new form is physically capable of doing so.
* Your equipment merges into your new form and has no effect until you leave the form.

When you gain the *Animagus Transformation* feature, you must decide between the two types of forms: Combat form or Evasion form. This is a permanent, one-time choice and will determine the stats and abilities of your animagus form.
#### Combat Form
A Combat animagus form is a large or powerful predator that can hold its own against dangerous creatures. It is both sturdy and capable of fighting back with lethal force.

Your form must be classified into one of two categories: Land or Water. If your chosen animal breathes and lives underwater, it must be Water. Otherwise, it will be Land, an air-breathing animal that lives on land and is incapable of flight. This classification will determine certain statistics and traits of your animagus form's stat block.

Combat forms can be one of two sizes: Medium or Large. Your form's size should be determined by the creature's actual size; for instance, all dogs would be Medium, not Large. You need your HM's approval to choose a Large-sized animagus form, and transforming into a Large animal may mean you'll be unable to transform in cramped spaces.

<div class='footnote'>Part 1 | Schools of Magic (Subclasses)</div>

\pagebreakNum
#### Evasion Form
An Evasion animagus form is a small and discreet animal that would not typically attract a lot of attention. It is likely prey in the natural word, surviving by being quiet, mobile and alert. Evasion forms are largely useless in combat, but can hide, escape and get to hard-to-reach places.

Your form must be classified into one of two categories: Land, Water or Air. If your chosen animal breathes and lives underwater, it must be Water. If it is an air-breathing animal that lives on land and is incapable of flight, it must be Land. If it is capable of sustained flight, it must be Air. This classification will determine certain statistics and traits of your animagus form's stat block.

Evasion forms can be one of three sizes: Tiny, Small or Medium. Your form's size should be determined by the creature's actual size; for instance, a cat would be Tiny and a hawk would be Small.

\columnbreak
#### Choosing an Animal
Your animagus form is the same animal as your corporeal patronus. Choose your animagus form from the animals listed in Appendix B: Patronus Rolling Tables. You should choose a patronus based on your desired animagus attributes (Combat vs. Evasion, Land vs. Water vs. Air). Your animagus form cannot be a magical beast. If you roll a magical beast (91-00 or 0) while determining your corporeal patronus, you must re-roll your patronus animal.

<div style="margin-bottom: 30px;"></div>

> ##### Different Mobilities
> It may make sense for a land animal to have different speeds. Work with your HM to customize your animagus form, like giving an otter swim speed, a monkey climb speed or a mole burrow speed. To compensate, the usual speed of 40 ft. should then be reduced to 30 ft.

## Healing
Healing magic is devoted to improving the physical and mental condition. With many different spells and potions, healing magic requires a wizard to be well-versed in magical conditions and their different remedies.
### Healers
A healer is the wizarding world equivalent of a Muggle doctor. They tend to the sick and injured, often finding employment in St Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries, England's primary wizarding hospital. Healers may find themselves facing artifact accidents, Dark creature bites, magical diseases, potion poisoning, or spell damage.
### Mediwizards
A mediwizard takes a much more active role in preserving life; if a healer is a doctor, then a mediwizard is a first responder. Mediwitches travel with research expeditions, watch over professional Quidditch, accompany monster hunters, and dive into war to save lives.

___
#### Moral Support

**Empathic Bond.** You feel others' pain deeply, which gives insight into their suffering.

If a creature you can see within 10 feet of you is targeted by a spell or attack, you can use your reaction to cast *protego* and leap in front of that creature, becoming the new target of the attack. If the spell or attack affects both of you and you step in front of that creature, you will be subject to the effects of that spell or attack twice.
___
#### Savior
At 18th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Phoenix Tears.** Your saint-like devotion to others and bravery in the face of danger has earned the respect of phoenixes. If you spend 8 hours reaching out with your magic, a phoenix will appear in a flash of fire and shed tears into a vial for you. Phoenix tears remove all curses, diseases, and poisons affecting a creature. Also, the creature regains all its hit points. A phoenix will only appear and fill a vial with tears when you do not have any other tears, and the phoenix tears will lose their healing properties if anyone other than you possesses the tears or tries to administer them.

**Healing Pulse.** Your healing and defensive magic have intertwined, energizing nearby allies. Whenever you cast a defensive spell, each non-hostile creature within 30 feet of you (including you) is healed a number of hit points equal to half its level.

## Divination
Divination is an unusual branch of magic involving gathering insights into past, present and future events. It is an inexact science, requiring interpretation of tea leaves and omens. Some believe true divination involves meditation and a belief of non-self to access the Inner Eye, while Centaurs have a unique way of practicing divination by observing the movement of planets, moons, and stars.
### Seers
Naturally gifted in divination, a seer is a wizard or witch who can see into the future with their Inner Eye. While some seers unknowingly utter prophecies about strangers, other seers will glimpse their own futures. Albus Dumbledore believed that seeing into the future is incredibly difficult, because the complexity of every action and its consequences.
### Legilimens
Legilimency is a far more tangible ability, navigating through the many layers of a person's mind and interpreting one's findings. Muggles call this âmind-reading,â but practitioners disdain the term as naive. They often practice occlumency, shielding your mind from the invasion of another legilimens. Although rare natural legilimens exist, it is a field of study that requires great dedication and care.

___

**Aura Reading.** Your connection with your Inner Eye allows you to see colorful auras around intelligent beings. You can immediately sense if a being is hostile, friendly or neutral.

After you use this ability, you canât use it again until you finish a long rest.

**Master of Minds.** *Legilimency required.* Your skill in navigating thoughts is unparalleled. You can now cast *legilimens* at-will, verbally or non-verbally. Any attempt to resist your *legilimens* spell is made at disadvantage.
### Divination Abilities
All of the following abilities can only be performed by using a Diviner's Kit. If you are not proficient in using the Diviner's Kit, there's a 33 percent chance your ability fails and you receive a random reading. You will not know your ability has failed. The HM makes this roll in secret.
#### Cartomancy
You gain insight into the past, present, and future of a being other than yourself by performing a tarot card reading. Your subject asks a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur within 7 days. By spending 6 sorcery points and 10 minutes, the cards tell you a story (a truthful reply from the HM). The cards' meaning might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an omen.

This ability doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as a different use of magic or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you perform a reading two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each reading after the first that you get a random reading. The HM makes this roll in secret.
#### Cleromancy
You focus your inner eye upon rune-inscribed sticks or Grindylow bones as you cast them on the ground. As an action, you can spend 2 sorcery points to interpret their meaning and advise one being of your choice within 30 feet of you. The next time the being makes an ability check, attack roll or saving throw within the next 10 minutes, the target can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to the attack roll or saving throw. This effect can only be active on one target at a time. If you are concentrating on a spell at the time of interpreting the sticks or bones, you lose concentration.

\columnbreak
#### Crystal-gazing
By gazing into the cloudy depths of the crystal ball, you can spend 7 sorcery points to see a particular creature you choose for 10 minutes. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you're using this ability, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it wants to be observed.

| Knowledge                     | Save Modifier  |
|:------------------------------------------|:--:|
| Secondhand (you have heard of the target) | 0 |
| Firsthand (you have met the target)       | -5 |
| Familiar (you know the target well)       | -10 |

On a successful save, the target isn't affected, and you can't use this ability against it again for 24 hours.

On a failed save, this ability lets you see as if you were there, within 10 feet of the target. Your view moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the duration.

Instead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this ability. When you do, your view shows that location and doesn't move.

#### Tasseomancy
The future is revealed through a uniquely complex reading of symbols and patterns within residual tea leaves a cup recently consumed by a being other than yourself. After ten minutes of preparation, you can spend 3 sorcery points to interpret the cup's omens and predict the results of a specific course of action that your subject plans to take within the next 30 minutes. The HM chooses from the following possible omens:

* **Weal**, for good results
* **Woe**, for bad results
* **Weal and woe**, for both good and bad results
* **Nothing**, for results that aren't especially good or bad

This ability doesn't take into account any possible circumstances that might change the outcome, such as a different use of magic or the loss or gain of a companion.

If you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The HM makes this roll in secret.

\pagebreakNum
## Magizoology
Magizoologists study magical creatures. As they work with many different creatures, the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures at the Ministry of Magic created a classification of every known beast, being and spirit, ranging from X to XXXXX. Whether harmless or an untameable wizard-killer, magizoologists record the unique traits of beasts for wizardkindâs safety.
### Dragon-Keepers
Dragon-keepers call the dragon reserve home, caring for the most famous XXXXX classified creature among wizards and Muggles alike. Spending day after day with them, dragon-keepers often learn to see through the eyes of their ward and empathize with the plight of many magical beasts. They seek to understand dragons for the benefit of all.
### Monster Hunters
Alternatively, some take a confrontational style of protection. When a wizarding village is plagued by a growing community of trolls, or they suspect a vampire is the cause of their dead livestock, they turn to a monster hunter. Dark creatures blur into the magical being category, so a monster hunter must deal with intelligent demi-humans just as well as corral a stray beast. It is up to the monster hunter to approach a situation wand blazing or seeking a peaceful resolution.
### Subclass Features
#### Biological Studies
At 1st level, you gain one of the following features.

**Caretaker.** Your study of magical creatures has taught you about their injuries and physiologies. You can cast any known Healing spells on beasts.

**Folio Bruti.** You have your own personal notebook of beasts where you record your findings. Whenever you add Magical Creatures proficiency to an Ability check, add your Intelligence modifier as a bonus as well.
___
#### Way of the Wild
At 6th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Wizard's Best Friend.** Your care and compassion towards creatures earns you their trust and respect. You can have a beast companion (see *Your Beast Companion* below).

**Prepared Ambush.** In learning to combat dangerous targets, you know how to place a magical trap, waiting to be sprung. When you cast a spell that targets a single creature or area using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can weave that spell into your surroundings, having no immediate effect. The spell is cast when it is triggered by something, which you decide at the time of setting the trap, such as entering an area, getting within a certain distance, or manipulating an object. You can also set conditions for creatures that don't trigger the spell, such as specific people or those who say a certain password.

Using this ability expends a spell slot two levels higher than the intended spell. For example, to set a 1st level spell as a magical trap, you must expend a 3rd level spell slot.

\columnbreak

If the spell requires a target, the spell can only target one triggering creature, or if it affects an area, the spell's area of effect is centered on the triggering creature. If the spell conjures hostile creatures, they appear as close as possible to the triggering creature and attack. If the spell requires concentration, it lasts its full duration. A trap can be detected by a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC, or by casting *specialis revelio*.

#### Outdoorswizard
At 10th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Survivalist.** You are particularly adept at traveling through and surviving in natural environments. 

You gain proficiency in either Herbology or Survival. Between Herbology and Survival, choose one that you're proficient in; your proficiency bonus is doubled when you make any check using that chosen skill. Also, you and your group gain the following benefits:
<div style='margin-top:-10px;'></div>

* Difficult terrain doesnât slow your groupâs travel.
* Your group can't be surprised while resting, as long as you are keeping watch.
* If a hit die roll is lower than their proficiency bonus, your group can reroll it once and take the higher result.

**Monster Hunting.** You have vast experience studying, tracking, and hunting creatures, allowing you to quickly adapt to threats. If you spend 10 minutes studying a beast or dark being's tracks, you automatically learn what the creature is, its size, and its speed. If you choose, that creature becomes and remains Hunted until you use this feature again.

You have advantage on Wisdom checks to track a Hunted creature and on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. While you're within 30 feet of a Hunted creature that you're actively tracking, you can sense its direction relative to you and distance in feet away from you.
#### Genus Genius
At 14th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Beast Whisperer.** You've learned the body language and social rituals of many beasts. As an action, you can use a Wisdom (Magical Creatures) check to attempt to soothe and calm a hostile beast. On success, the beast believes you mean it no harm and is neutral to the party. The effect is canceled if you or a party member inflicts any damage or condition on that beast or any identical beasts. You cannot use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.

**Exploited Vulnerabilities.** You know exactly how to hit where it hurts. As a bonus action, you can call out an enemy's weaknesses to your allies. The target takes an additional 2d8 damage from your allies' damaging spells until the start of your next turn. You have a number of uses equal to your Intelligence modifier, and uses are restored after a long rest.

___
#### Sixth Sense
At 18th level, you gain one of the following features.

**Draconic Empathy.** *Wizard's Best Friend required.* Your dedication as a dragon-keeper allows you to deeply understand dragons. If you've ever raised a dragon from an egg, it will view you as an ally and can serve as your beast companion. Tamed dragons have their own hit points, hit dice, and ability scores, and use natural attack actions.

**Hunter's Reflexes.** You've precisely honed your instincts in combat. As a reaction to a creature you can see casting a spell or attacking, you can cast a spell with a casting time of one action, bonus action, or reaction, targeting only that creature. Conditions and damage are applied before the target completes their action. Damage dealt to the target imposes disadvantage on its attack roll. You cannot use this feature again until you complete a short or long rest.
### Your Beast Companion
___
#### Bonding with Your Beast
With 8 hours of uninterrupted communication and bonding, you can call upon a non-hostile beast to serve as your faithful companion. When you gain this feature, select your companion from any Medium or larger single beast of challenge rating 1/4 or lower. You can have only one beast companion at a time.

Your beast companion obeys your commands as best it can. The beast moves and acts during your turn, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. You and your companion can move and act in any order you choose. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.

Your companion will fight in unison with you. The following rules apply while it is bonded to you by this feature:
* It can't use its natural attack actions, but it can make unarmed
strikes. Its damage die for unarmed strikes becomes a d4.
* It is proficient in two saving throws and two skills of your choice, in addition to its normal proficiencies.
* It uses your proficiency bonus for attacks, as well as for saving throws and skills in which it is proficient.
* It adds your proficiency bonus to its armor class.

To find your companion's maximum hit points, take the stat block's hit points and add 5 times your caster level. Whenever you gain an Ability Score Improvement, you can also allocate two points among your companion's ability scores. If your beast companion is ever slain or dismissed, a bond may be formed with another beast and that beast will progress according to your current level.

#### Commanding Your Beast
You train your companion to follow certain commands. You have a number of Command Dice equal to half your level (rounded down) + your Wisdom modifier. A command die is a d6, and it is used to issue specifically trained commands to beasts, including your beast companion.

You can issue one command at a time to a beast within 120 feet of you that can hear you; the beast must be able to hear you to follow the command, and the command is wasted if the beast doesn't fulfill it before the end of its next turn. When a command die is rolled, its use is expended. Your command die becomes a d8 when you reach 14th level.

You regain all command dice when you finish a long rest.

##### Beast Commands
Your companion knows two beast commands of your choice. It learns an additional command when you reach 14th level. You can also teach any friendly beast other than your companion only one beast command by spending at least 1 hour per day for 7 days training the creature.

**Attack.** You can use your bonus action and roll a command die to issue this command. Your companion can use its action to take one of its natural attack actions. However, it can't use its Multiattack action, if it has one. If the attack hits, add the result of the command die to the damage roll.

**Down.** You can use your bonus action and roll a command die to issue this command. Your companion uses its reaction to fall prone and attempt to Hide, adding the result of the command die to its Dexterity (Stealth) check. The first attack it makes while hidden in this way also adds the result of the command die to its attack roll.

**Find.** You can use your bonus action and roll a command die to issue this command. Your companion uses its reaction to attempt to Search for hidden creatures or objects, adding the result of the command die to the Search's skill check.

**Grab.** When your companion makes an opportunity attack, you can use your reaction and roll a command die to issue this command. If the attack hits, your companion can attempt to grapple the target as part of the attack, adding the result of the command die to the skill check it makes for the attempt.

**Rush.** You can use your bonus action and roll a command die to issue this command. Your companion uses its reaction to take the Help action, aiding the next attack against a creature within its reach that it can see. If this attack hits, add the result of the command die to the attack's damage.

# Chapter 4: Wands (Backgrounds)
Every witch and wizard purchases a wand before their first year at Hogwarts, and spends their entire life using that wand, unless they break it or win another wand in combat. The conduit through which their magic flows, a wand is a deeply personal and valuable possession to wizards. Those knowledgable in wandlore will often describe a wand as if it can think and feel. Every single wand is unique and its character will depend on the particular tree and magical creature from which it derives its materials. Moreover, each wand, from the moment it finds its ideal owner, will begin to learn from and teach its human partner.

\columnbreak
## Wand Components
### Wood
Only a minority of trees produce wand quality wood (just as a minority of humans can produce magic), so it takes years of experience to tell which trees have the gift. A wandâs wood determines the core personality of the wand. As Garrick Ollivander said, the wand chooses the wizard, and so the wood of a wand tells you about the wizard who wields it.
<div style='margin: 0 0 0 140px;'>

### Cores
#### Unicorn Hair
Unicorn hair generally produces the most consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations and blockages. Wands with unicorn cores are generally the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts. 

They are the most faithful of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was an accomplished witch or wizard. Minor disadvantages of unicorn hair are that they do not make the most powerful wands (although the wand wood may compensate) and that they are prone to melancholy if seriously mishandled, meaning that the hair may âdieâ and need replacing.</div>
#### Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Dragon Heartstring
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As a rule, dragon heartstrings produce Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â wands with the most power, and which are Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â capable of the most flamboyant spells. Dragon Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â wands tend to learn more quickly than other Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â types. While they can change allegiance if won from Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â their original master, they always bond strongly with Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â the current owner. The dragon wand tends to be easiest Â Â Â Â to turn to the Dark Arts, though it will not incline that way of its own accord. It is also the most prone of the three cores to accidents, being somewhat temperamental.
#### Phoenix Feather
Phoenix feather is the rarest core type. Phoenix feathers are capable of the greatest range of magic, though they may take longer than either unicorn or dragon cores to reveal this. They show the most initiative, sometimes acting of their own accord, a quality that many witches and wizards dislike. 

Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest when it comes to potential owners, for the creature from which they are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world. These wands are the hardest to tame and to personalize, and their allegiance is usually hard won.
<div class='footnote'>Part 1 | Wands (Backgrounds)</div>

\pagebreakNum

#### Uncommon Wand Cores
Those three wand cores are the only kinds of wands crafted by Garrick Ollivander, but many other wand cores exist. Around the world and in the shops of other wand makers, you might find wands with cores of Kelpie hair, Dittany stalk, Kneazle whisker, Veela hair, coral, or even troll whisker. These unusual cores have a reputation for being less reliable, but sometimes an uncommon core produces a wand that's the perfect match for a one-of-a-kind wizard.
### Length
Many wandmakers simply match the wand length to the size of the witch or wizard who will use it, but this is a crude measure, and fails to take into account many other, important considerations. Longer wands might suit taller wizards, but they tend to be drawn to bigger personalities, and those of a more spacious and dramatic style of magic. Neater wands favour more elegant and refined spell-casting. However, no single aspect of wand composition should be considered in isolation of all the others, and the type of wood, the core and the flexibility may either counterbalance or enhance the attributes of the wandâs length.

Most wands will be in the range of nine and fourteen inches. Extremely short wands (eight inches and under) and very long wands (over fifteen inches) are exceptionally rare. In the latter case, a physical peculiarity demanded the excessive wand length. However, abnormally short wands usually select those in whose character something is lacking, rather than because they are physically undersized.
### Flexibility
Wand flexibility or rigidity denotes the degree of adaptability and willingness to change possessed by the wand-and-owner pair. Although, again, this factor ought not to be considered separately from the wand wood, core and length, nor of the ownerâs life experience and style of magic, all of which will combine to make the wand in question unique.
## Backgrounds
Wand woods are grouped into backgrounds based on their general traits, which help define your character and determine your background skill proficiencies and background feature. Once you've selected your background, choose a wood. Then select your remaining wand components: core, length, and flexibility. You are free to create any combination of Ideals, Bonds, and Flaws to match the personality of your witch or wizard.

Â 
> ##### Mix-and-Match Wandmaking
> Like 5e, character backgrounds are entirely customizable. Even wand woods are mere suggestions, and any wood can be paired with any background. Feel free to work with your HM to modify an existing background or create a brand new one to bring your character concept to life.

### Artist
You see yourself as an observer of the world around you, capturing little glimpses of that world. You express yourself through those glimpses, satisfying your need to create and communicating your own unique perspective. Your chosen medium might be magically developed moving photographs, a painted portrait with a personality, a bewitched sculpture or even enchanted cartography.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Insight, Performance

**Equipment:** The tools of the art medium of your choice (e.g. painter's supplies, musical instrument, costume, etc.), and a sketch pad with charcoal sticks
#### Background Feature: Apprentice
Although you're not yet able to create original works, you have enough knowledge and rudimentary skills to begin an apprenticeship under a mentor, should you find one willing to teach you. Additionally, you've become practiced in hand-eye coordination and precise work.
<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>

|:---:|:--------------|
| 1-2 | Pine          |
| 3-4 | Red Oak       |
| 5-6 | Sycamore      |
#### Pine
Pine wands always choose an independent, individual master who may be perceived as a loner, intriguing and perhaps mysterious. Pine wands enjoy being used creatively, and unlike some others, will adapt unprotestingly to new methods and spells. Many wandmakers insist that pine wands are able to detect, and perform best for, owners who are destined for long lives. The pine wand is one of those that are sensitive to non-verbal magic.
#### Red Oak
You will often hear the ignorant say that red oak is an infallible sign of its ownerâs hot temper. In fact, the true match for a red oak wand is possessed of unusually fast reactions, making it a perfect duelling wand. Less common than English oak, its ideal master is light of touch, quick-witted and adaptable, often the creator of distinctive, trademark spells, and a good man or woman in a fight.
#### Sycamore
The sycamore makes a questing wand, eager for experience and losing brilliance in mundane activities. These may combust if allowed to become âbored,â and many aging witches and wizards are disconcerted to find their wand bursting into flame as they ask it, one more time, to fetch their slippers. The sycamoreâs ideal owner is curious,

\columnbreak

 vital and adventurous, and with such an owner, it demonstrates a highly-prized capacity to learn and adapt.

#### Variant Artist: Performer
Even moreso than visual artists, you're compelled to express yourself, your experiences and your emotions. While you aren't immune to bouts of uncertainty and performance anxiety, you generally seem to be quite extraverted. You've found your calling in at least one of the performing arts: singing, dancing, playing an instrument or magical theater.

### Bookworm
You've always been known to have your nose in a book, whether obsessing over homework or escaping reality into a world of fiction. You often solve your problems through research and study. Because you absorb so much from others, you've learned things, traveled places, felt emotions, and seen wonders far beyond your own experiences.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Magical Theory, Investigation

**Equipment:** Your favorite book, a book you're </br>currently reading, and a small back-up quill
#### Background Feature: Teacher's Pet
Because you are a bright individual, teachers and those in positions of authority are more likely to interpret your actions and intentions favorably. You might be in a better position to enlist their help, or have plausible deniability based on your academic reputation.

|:-:|:------------|
| 1 | Beech       |
| 2 | Hornbeam    |
| 3 | Vine        |
| 4 | Walnut      |
#### Beech
The true match for a beech wand will be, if young, wise beyond his or her years, and if full-grown, rich in understanding and experience. Beech wands perform very weakly for the narrow-minded and intolerant. When properly matched, the beech wand is capable of a subtlety and artistry not seen in any other wood, hence its lustrous reputation.
#### Hornbeam
Hornbeam, a fine-tuned and sentient wand, selects for its life mate the talented witch or wizard with a single, pure passion. Hornbeam wands adapt more quickly to their ownerâs style of magic and become so personalized, so quickly, that others will find them extremely difficult to use. They likewise absorb their ownerâs code of honor and will refuse to perform acts - good or ill - conflicting with their masterâs principles. 
#### Vine
Vine wands are among the less common types, and their ideal owners are nearly always those witches or wizards who seek a greater purpose, have a vision beyond the ordinary and frequently astound those who think they know them best. Vine wands seem strongly attracted by personalities with hidden depths, and often instantly detect a match.
#### Walnut
Walnut wands are often found in the hands of highly intelligent magical innovators and inventors; this is a handsome wood possessed of unusual versatility and adaptability. Walnut wands will, once subjugated, perform any task its owner desires, provided that the user is of sufficient brilliance. This makes for a truly lethal weapon in the hands of a witch or wizard of no conscience, for the wand and the wizard may feed on each other in an unhealthy manner.

#### Variant Bookworm: Prodigy
You've always exhibited unusual control over your magical abilities. Where others struggle, things come naturally to you. The ease with which you gain knowledge or skills sometimes results in arrogance or naivete. You've also been burdened with greater expectations and if you entered wizarding school early or skipped a year, you're accustomed to being younger than your peers.

### Dreamer
Your dreams fill your thoughts, distracted by all of life's possibilities. Introspection comes easily to you and frankly, you don't understand how a person can live without looking for meaning, thinking deeply about society's values, or being overcome with wonder. You might even feel out of place in a world of people focused on material success and just getting through the day.

**Equipment:** Astronomer's tools, and a mystical trinket you believe gives you protection (but doesn't)
#### Background Feature: Stargazer
Many of your nights are spent staring up at space, contemplating existence. You're a natural at Astronomy and share the Centaurs' views on the importance of the heavens. Your affinity for the ethereal also leads ghosts to be more trusting of you and more forthcoming with information.

| 5-6 | Hazel         |
| 7-8 | Redwood       |
| 9-10| Silver Lime   |
#### Black Walnut
Less common than the standard walnut wand, black walnut wands seek a master of good instincts and powerful insight. Black walnut is a very handsome wood, but is not the easiest to master. If the wand is paired with a sincere, self-aware owner, however, it becomes one of the most loyal and impressive wands of all, with a particular flair in all kinds of charmwork.
#### Cedar
Never matched to the easily-fooled, the cedar wand finds its perfect home where there is perspicacity and perception. Some wandmakers would go further than that, saying one should never cross the owner of a cedar wand, especially if harm is done to their allies or kin. The witch or wizard who is well-matched with cedar carries the potential to be a frightening adversary, which often comes as a shock to those who have thoughtlessly challenged them.
#### Hazel
A sensitive wand, hazel often reflect its ownerâs emotional state and works best for a master who understands and can manage their own feelings. Others should be careful handling a hazel wand if its owner has been angered or disappointed, because the wand will absorb such energy and discharge it unpredictably. It is capable of outstanding magic in the hands of the skilful and is so devoted to its owner that it often âwiltsâ at the end of their master's life.

\columnbreak
#### Redwood
Wand-quality redwood is in short supply due to its reputation for bringing good fortune. As usual with wandlore, the populace has it backwards: redwood wands are not themselves lucky, but are strongly attracted to witches and wizards who already possess the admirable ability to fall on their feet, to make the right choice, to snatch advantage from catastrophe. One can expect to hear of exciting exploits when such a witch or wizard wields a redwood wand.
#### Silver Lime
This unusual and highly attractive wand wood was greatly in vogue in the nineteenth century, and demand consistently outstripped supply. The reasons for these wandsâ desirability lay not only in their unusually handsome appearance, but also because they had a reputation for performing best for Seers and those skilled in Legilimency, mysterious arts both, which consequently gave the possessor of a silver lime wand considerable status.

### Groundskeeper
Your childhood has always been spent outdoors, climbing trees or capturing insects.

#### Chestnut
This is a most curious, multi-faceted wood, which takes a great deal of colour from the personality that possesses it. The wand of chestnut is attracted to witches and wizards who are skilled tamers of magical beasts and those who are natural fliers. However, three successive heads of the Wizengamot have possessed chestnut and unicorn wands, for this combination shows a predilection for those concerned with all manner of justice.

\columnbreak
#### English Oak
A wand for good times and bad, this is a friend as loyal as the wizard who deserves it. Wands of English oak demand partners of strength, courage and fidelity. Less well-known is the propensity for owners of English oak wands to have powerful intuition, and, often, an affinity with the magic of the natural world, with the creatures and plants that are necessary to wizardkind.
#### Maple
Garrick Ollivander found that witches and wizards chosen by maple wands, a beautiful and desirable wood, are by nature travelers and explorers. They are not stay-at-home wands, and prefer ambition in their owner, otherwise their magic grows lackluster. Fresh challenges and regular changes of scene cause this wand to literally shine, burnishing itself as it grows with its partner in ability and status, earning its reputation as the wand of high achievers.
#### Poplar
Poplar wands can be relied upon, wands of consistency, strength and uniform power. Always happiest when working with a witch or wizard of clear moral vision, some wizards joke that a poplar wand has never chosen a politician. However, two of the Ministryâs most accomplished Ministers for Magic, Eldritch Diggory and Evangeline Orpington, were possessors of fine, Ollivander-made poplar wands.

### Klutz
Maybe you're an incredibly uncoordinated person, or perhaps you inherited a particularly petty curse. Whatever the cause, you continually find yourself in the middle of mishaps and blunders. Since being accident-prone is a very dangerous thing to be in the wizarding world, you tend to be hypervigilant and wary of your surroundings.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Medicine, Perception

**Equipment:** A lucky charm, and a package of plasters
#### Background Feature: Walking Disaster
You've seen so many situations go completely awry that you've started being able to predict all the ways things can go wrong. If you're looking to hinder something or bring about a dangerous accident, you'll have no shortage of ideas.
<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>

| 3-4 | Cypress       |
| 5-6 | Willow        |
<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>

#### Ash
The ash wand clings to its one true master and ought not to be passed on or gifted from the original owner, because it will lose power and skill. Witches and wizards best suited to ash wands are not lightly swayed from their beliefs or purposes. However, a brash or over-confident witch or wizard will be disappointed by its effects. The ideal owner may be stubborn, and will certainly be courageous, but never crass or arrogant.

\columnbreak
#### Cypress
Cypress wands are associated with nobility and dying a heroic death, historically. Fortunately, the possessors of cypress wands are rarely called upon to lay down their lives, but doubtless many of them would do so if required. Wands of cypress find their soulmates among the brave, the bold and the self-sacrificing: those who are unafraid to confront the shadows in their own and othersâ natures.
#### Willow
Willow is an uncommon wand wood with healing power, and their ideal owner often has some (usually unwarranted) insecurity, however well they may try and hide it. With a handsome appearance and well-founded reputation for enabling advanced, non-verbal magic, the willow wands have consistently selected those of greatest potential, rather than those who feel they have little to learn.

### Potioneer
More than once, you've been accused of perfectionism, but your attention to detail allows you to succeed where others fail. This trait shines when you turn your focus to brewing potions. You approach situations with drive and vigor, and live with strong conviction in your values and principles.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Herbology, Potion-making

**Tool Proficiencies:** Potioneer's kit

**Equipment:** A potioneer's kit, and a muggle notebook with a ballpoint pen
#### Background Feature: Regular Customer
You're a familiar face to any prominent wizarding apothecary, and as a frequent customer, you get access to new and unusual inventory that potion supplies stores may not want to open up to the public. You've also picked up one common and one uncommon potion recipe of your choice.

<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>

| <span style='padding:0px 10px;'>d4</span> | Wood (Personality Traits) |
|:-:|:------------|
| 1 | Acacia      |
| 2 | Elm         |
| 3 | Larch       |
| 4 | Laurel      |
#### Acacia
This very unusual wand wood creates tricky wands that often refuse to produce magic for any but their owner, and also withholds their best effects from all but those most gifted. This makes them difficult to place, and wandmakers often keep only a small stock for those witches or wizards of sufficient subtlety, for acacia is not suited to what is commonly known as âbangs-and-smellsâ magic. When well-matched, an acacia wand matches any for power, though it is often underrated due to the peculiarity of its temperament.
#### Elm
Elm wands prefer owners with presence, magical dexterity and a certain native dignity. Although some wizards have spread rumors that elm wandsâ magic requires blood purity, there have been perfect matches of elm wands who 


\columnbreak
<div style='margin-top: 270px;'></div>

are Muggle-borns. Of all wand woods, elm produces the fewest accidents, the least foolish errors, and the most elegant charms and spells; these are sophisticated wands, capable of highly advanced magic in the right hands.
#### Larch
Larch wands have a reputation for instilling confidence and courage in the user. The celebrated wandmaker Garrick Ollivander found that larch always created wands of hidden talents and unexpected effects, which likewise describes the master who deserves it. It is often the case that the witch or wizard who belongs to the larch wand may never realize the full extent of their considerable talents until paired with it, but that they will then make an exceptional match.
#### Laurel
It is said a laurel wand cannot perform a dishonourable act, although in the ownerâs quest for glory, laurel wands can perform powerful and sometimes lethal magic. The laurel wand seems unable to tolerate laziness in a possessor, and in that case, can be won away from their owner most easily. Otherwise, it will cleave happily to its first match and issue a spontaneous zap if another attempts to steal it.

<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>


### Protector
You have a strong sense of justice and do everything you can to stand up for victims, likely because of an instinctive empathy or your own history of being victimized. Seeing a narcissist take advantage of someone else makes you feel sick. You've made sure you're physically capable of stopping the people you care about from being hurt, so you make an excellent ally to the downtrodden.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Athletics, Intimidation

**Equipment:** A Beater's bat, and a picture of a loved one
#### Background Feature: People's Champ
The way you carry yourself makes people comfortable and confident that you can help them when they're feeling harrassed or imperiled. As long as you live up to your reputation, your noble deeds can make you a shoo-in for prefect, team captain or other small positions of authority.
<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>

|:---:|:--------------|
| 1-2 | Blackthorn    |
| 3-4 | Hawthorn      |
| 5-6 | Mahogany      |
| 7-8 | Rowan         |
| 9-10| Yew           |
<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>

#### Blackthorn
A very unusual wand wood, blackthorn wands have the reputation of being best suited to a warrior. One finds blackthorn wands among the Aurors as well as among the denizens of Azkaban. These wands appear to need to pass through danger or hardship with their owners to become truly bonded. Given this condition, the blackthorn wand will become a loyal and faithful servant.
#### Hawthorn
Hawthorn wands may be particularly suited to healing magic, but they are also adept at curses, and it has been generally observed that the hawthorn wand seems most at home with a conflicted nature or a period of turmoil. Hawthorn wands are not easy to master, however, and one should only ever be placed in the hands of a witch or wizard of proven talent. Hawthorn wands have a notable peculiarity: their spells can, when badly handled, backfire.

\columnbreak
#### Mahogany
The mahogany tree symbolizes strength, safety, protectiveness, and practicality, and these traits are mirrored in a mahogany wandâs suitable match. With plenty of power and a knack for transfiguration, the owners of mahogany wands are often reliable and serve as cornerstones for their local wizard community.
#### Rowan
Rowan wood has always been much-favored for wands, because it is reputed to be more protective than any other and renders all manner of defensive charms especially strong and difficult to break. It is also commonly stated that no dark witch or wizard ever owned a rowan wand. Rowan is most happily placed with the clear-headed and the pure-hearted, but this reputation for virtue ought not to fool anyone â these wands frequently outperform others in duels.
#### Yew
Yew wands are among the rarer kinds, and their ideal matches are likewise unusual and occasionally notorious. The wand of yew is reputed to endow the power of life and death, retaining a fearsome reputation in the spheres of duelling and curses. However, a witch or wizard might equally prove a fierce protector. Where wizards have been buried with wands of yew, the wand generally sprouts into a tree guarding the ownerâs grave. A yew wand never chooses either a mediocre or a timid owner.

#### Variant Protector: Bully
When you feel powerless, you hurt those weaker than you to regain some semblance of control. It might be a necessary coping mechanism, an assertive demeanor or an innately sadistic nature. You might even be very selective about your victims or only lash out in relatively harmless ways. Regardless, you're a bully and you thrive off of feeling superior.
<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>

> ##### Variant Feature: Common Thug
> Everyone who's heard of you has heard of your misdeeds, and they will know to come to you when they need someone to take care of their dirty work. The faint of heart will immediately fear you and try to escape your ire by letting you boss them around.
<div style='margin-top: 40px;'></div>

### Quidditch Fan
Whether your fondest childhood memories were at your local team's matches or you just discovered the sport upon arriving at Hogwarts, you **love** quidditch. It makes complete sense, given your competitive streak and affinity for rough-housing. You use your common sense and ability to take initiative to get by.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Acrobatics, Athletics

**Tool Proficiencies:** Vehicle (Broomstick)

**Equipment:** A quaffle, and a chocolate frog card of your favorite quidditch player
#### Background Feature: Superfan
It seems like you can only think about broomsticks and quaffles. You're always on top of recent matches, the latest brooms, and quidditch tactics. Also, you can easily strike up conversation and build rapport with a fellow enthusiast.

| <span style='padding:0px 10px;'>d6</span> | Wood (Personality Traits) |
|:---:|:----------|
| 1-2 | Cherry    |
| 3-4 | Fir       |
| 5-6 | Spruce    |
<div style='margin-top: 20px;'></div>

#### Cherry
This very rare wand wood creates a wand of strange power, most highly prized by the wizarding students of the school of Mahoutokoro in Japan, where those who own cherry wands have special prestige. The Western wand-purchaser should dispel from their minds any notion that the pink blossom

\columnbreak
<div style='margin-top: 130px;'></div>

of the living tree makes for a frivolous or merely ornamental wand, for cherry wood often makes a wand that possesses truly lethal power, whatever the core.
#### Fir
One wandmaker called wands of fir wood âthe survivorâs wandâ, because he had sold it to three wizards who subsequently passed through mortal peril unscathed. There is no doubt that this wood, coming as it does from the most resilient of trees, produces wands that demand staying power and strength of purpose in their true owners. Fir wands are particularly suited to Transfiguration, and favour owners of focused, strong-minded and, occasionally, intimidating demeanor.
#### Spruce
Spruce wands are ill-matched with cautious or nervous natures, becoming positively dangerous in fumbling fingers. They require a firm hand, because they seem to have their own ideas about what magic it ought to produce. However, when a spruce wand meets its match in a bold spell-caster with a good sense of humor, it becomes a superb helper. Intensely loyal to owners, the wands are capable of producing particularly flamboyant and dramatic effects.

### Socialite
You seem to make friends wherever you go. It might be your forceful personality or the delicious gossip, but no matter what it is, people are drawn to you. You enjoy being the center of attention and feel invigorated by lively crowds, but you might get carried away with impressing your admirers.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Deception, Persuasion

**Equipment:** A ring with a family crest or another type of heirloom jewelry, and a peacock feather quill
#### Background Feature: Rumor-Monger
Your skill at making connections has earned you inroads with people in the know. When you attempt to uncover a particularly juicy secret or a dangerous rumor, your sources may be able to help you or point you in the right direction.

#### Alder
While the wood itself is unyielding, the ideal owner of an alder wand is not stubborn or obstinate, but often helpful, considerate and most likeable. When an alder wand is happily placed, it becomes a magnificent, loyal helpmate. Of all wand types, alder is best suited to non-verbal spell work, whence comes its reputation for being suitable only for the most advanced witches and wizards.
#### Apple
Applewood wands are not made in great numbers. They are powerful and best suited to an owner of high aims and ideals, as this wood mixes poorly with Dark magic. It is said that the possessor of an apple wand will be well-loved and long-lived, and wizards of great personal charm often find their perfect match in an applewood wand.
#### Aspen
Wand-quality aspen wood is prized for its stylish resemblance to ivory and usually outstanding charmwork. The proper owner of the aspen wand is often an accomplished duellist, for the aspen wand is particularly suited to martial magic. An infamous and secretive eighteenth-century duelling club, the Silver Spears, only admitted owners of aspen wands. Owners are generally strong-minded and determined, likely to be attracted by quests; this is a wand for revolutionaries.
#### Pear
The golden-toned wood of pear produces wands of splendid magical powers. Possessors of pear wands are usually popular and well-respected, and no one knows of a single instance where a pear wand was in the possession of a Dark witch or wizard. Pear wands are among the most resilient, and they commonly keep a remarkable appearance of newness, even after many years of hard use.

#### Variant Socialite: Follower
Instead of building social status through the force of your own personality, you've found success by following someone who is more influential or popular than you are. You know how to stay useful to them and use their reputation to influence others. Whether you see yourself as a hero's sidekick or a bully's sycophant, you're happy to watch from the sidelines and be second best.

### Troublemaker
Whether you consider yourself a purveyor of pranks or simply a curious soul, trouble tends to follow you wherever you go. As a result, you've learned to be a little more careful and avoid the obvious pitfalls of rule-breaking. That's very useful, as there's no shortage of messes you get yourself into.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Sleight of Hand, Stealth

**Equipment:** A fake hall pass, and a small pack of Exploding Whizz Poppers
#### Background Feature: Creative Thinker
Having found yourself in some predicaments, you're quick to look for a way out; "work smart, not hard" is your motto. Your invented alibis always sound half-reasonable to others, and you're good at finding figurative and literal shortcuts. Also, rule-breakers are more willing to share their secrets with you.

| 3 | Elder     |
| 4 | Holly     |
#### Dogwood
Dogwood wands are quirky, noisy, and mischievous; they have playful natures and insist upon partners who provide excitement and fun. It would be quite wrong to think dogwood wands arenât capable of serious magic; they perform outstanding spells in difficult conditions, and with a suitably clever owner, can produce dazzling enchantments.
#### Ebony
Ebony wands are impressive in appearance and reputation, being highly suited to Transfiguration and combative magic. Ebony is happiest in the hand of those with the courage to be themselves. Frequently non-conformist or comfortable with being an outsider, the ebony wandâs perfect match will not be swayed lightly from their beliefs and purpose.
#### Elder
The rarest wand wood of all, and reputed to be unlucky (a baseless superstition), elder wands are trickiest to master. They contain powerful magic, but scorn any owner who is not a superior caster; it takes a remarkable wizard to keep an elder wand. The truth is that only a highly unusual person will find their perfect match in elder, but that witch or wizard in question is certainly marked out for a special destiny.

\columnbreak
#### Holly
Holly is one of the rarer kinds of wand woods; traditionally considered protective, it works most happily for those who may need help overcoming a tendency to anger and impetuosity. At the same time, holly wands often choose owners engaged in some dangerous and often spiritual quest. Holly is a notoriously difficult wood to team with phoenix feather, but should such a pairing find its match, nothing and nobody should stand in their way.

# Chapter 5: Wizarding Equipment
Every witch and wizard remembers their first visit to Diagon Alley: a bustling street lined with vendors hawking their extraordinary wares. The vibrant energy reaches its peak during school shopping in the summer. From broomsticks to boomslang skin to Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, you can find it in those wondrous stores. Being properly equipped is essential in the wizarding world, whether you're buying school supplies for your first year at Hogwarts or stocking up for cursebreaking an ancient tomb.
## Starting Equipment
Wizards and witches start their journey at a very young age and most of their expenses are covered by their parents or Hogwarts. Because of this, a typical student will be given a Student's Pack and a small amount of spending money.

</br>

> ##### Equipment Packs and Family Finances
> Because a first-year student at Hogwarts is typically 11 years old, a character starting at level 1 will depend on their family to buy their school supplies. Their financial situation decides how much spending money they start with and what quality of equipment they receive. Choose from the options below, and use this starting wealth instead of the starting wealth granted by your background.
>
> **Hand-Me-Down Student's Pack.** Includes a patched-up schoolbag, 3 sets of darned and worn work robes (black) with name tags sewn in, a crumpled pointed hat (black), a 10-foot roll of parchment, a quill, and a bottle of black ink. When receiving this pack for the first time, it also includes a pouch containing 5 sickles.
>
> **Standard Student's Pack.** Includes a standard schoolbag, 3 sets of plain work robes (black) with name tags sewn in, a plain pointed hat (black), 2 10-foot rolls of parchment, 3 quills, and 2 bottles of black ink. When receiving this pack for the first time, it also includes a pouch containing 15 sickles.
>
> **Wealthy Student's Pack.** Includes a rip-proof schoolbag, 3 sets of luxurious work robes (black) with name tags sewn in, a fancy pointed hat (black), 3 10-foot rolls of parchment, 5 quills, 2 bottles of black ink, a bottle of emerald green ink, and a bottle of scarlet ink. When receiving this pack for the first time, it also includes a pouch containing 2 galleons.

\columnbreak

Hogwarts also requires some fundamental supplies from a potioneer's kit, like a full-size cauldron and measuring scales, and herbologist's tools, like dragon-hide gloves. Despite them being on the official shopping list, these items won't be carried around by your average Hogwarts student and require the appropriate toolset to keep them handy.
## Tools
A tool helps you to do a number of things, usually associated with a Hogwarts subject or wizarding profession. A defining factor of all of these tools is that they come in a compact and convenient container. These cases will either fit within or alongside a standard schoolbag.

**Astronomer's Tools.** This tubular case contains a featherlight-charmed travel telescope, a sextant, an astro-compass, several star charts, spare parchment, ink and a quill.

**Curse-breakers' Tools.** The Curse-breakers' tools include a curse sneakoscope, a compact secrecy sensor, an eye loupe set, a collapsible retriever tool with a hook on the end, a small mirror and a very large pair of tweezers. Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using finite incantatem or to remove a curse from an object or an area.

**Diviner's Kit.** The Diviner's kit is a small carpet bag containing a wide range of divination equipment, including tea leaves, a tea cup and saucer, a travel tea pot, grindylow bones, rune inscribed sticks, a deck of tarot cards and a small crystal ball. Proficiency with this kit allows you to make more accurate predictions with your Divination Abilities. Divination Abilities cannot be performed without this kit.

**Herbologist's Tools.** This set of tools includes a trowel, hand cultivator, pruning shears, dragon-hide gloves, twine, small burlap sacks, a few small pots and a pair of earmuffs.

**Potioneer's Kit.** The Potioneer's Kit includes a set of brass scales, silver knife, cutting board, mortar and pestle, measuring cups, eye dropper and vials, jars and flasks, as well as some staple ingredients that aren't included in recipes.

## Wealth
### Optional Coinage
Wizard money can often seem strange and incomprehensible to Muggles, so they may be more comfortable using terms they're familiar with, like gold pieces. However, it's actually not too hard to keep straight the values of the copper, silver, and gold coins issued by Gringottâs, when you convert it to Muggle value (United States Dollars are used in the following examples). 

The copper Knut is the smallest denomination. 29 Knuts make one silver Sickle. 17 Sickles (or 493 Knuts) make one Galleon, the large gold coin. Approximately speaking, one Knut is worth one nickel ($0.05), which means a Sickle is $1.45 and a Galleon is $24.65. A Gringottâs Standard ruby is worth 20 galleons (or $493).

#####  Exchange Rates (Rounded)
| Name    | Conversion  | USD    | GBP    | D&D    |
|:--------|------------:|-------:|-------:|-------:|
| Knut    | --          | $0.05  | Â£0.04  | 1/5 cp |
| Sickle  | 29 Knuts    | $1.50  | Â£1.20  | 6 cp   |
| Galleon | 17 Sickles  | $25.00 | Â£20.00 | 1 gp   |
| Ruby    | 20 Galleons | $500.00 | Â£400.00 | 2 pp |

## Cloaks (Armor)
In the wizarding world, mundane armor is useless against spells. The best way to survive a duel is to avoid being hit.

**Winter Cloak.** One of the required supplies for attendance at Hogwarts, this heavy winter cloak keeps its wearer quite warm in cold, snowy winters. A winter cloak helps conceal a duelist's intended movements from their opponents, but the weight and bulk can be a hindrance.

**Silk Cloak.** All of the concealing benefits of a cloak with none of the unwieldy bulk, a silk cloak is the preferred travel wear of experienced duelists. The smooth and lightweight material allows for a full range of movement and nimbleness.

**Shield Cloak.** Popular in times of war and always in high demand among Aurors, a shield cloak is a standard silk cloak that's been enchanted with the *protego* charm. While nowhere near as effective as the actual Shield Charm, the enchantment provides minor spell resistance that can make the difference between life and death.

**Demiguise Cloak.** A demiguise cloak is a rough cloak woven with a thick silvery-white fiber. The outer layer is made from the hair of a Demiguise, a rare and elusive magical creature from Asia with the ability to turn invisible at will. The cloak functions as perfect camouflage from all angles, but when the wearer moves, there is a perceptible delay before the cloak matches its new surroundings. In combat, this often gives its wearer a visible but blurred appearance.

**Disillusionment Cloak.** Created by weaving *pellucidi pellis* and a few other enchantments into a silk cloak, the disillusionment cloak has no delay, functioning as an effective invisibility cloak. However, in a certain light, an onlooker may be able to see a slightly distorted outline of the cloak's shape. In combat, it's quite effective, but as with any invisibility cloak, the wearer becomes partially visible if they open it to cast a spell.
### Donning and Doffing Cloaks
The time it takes to don (put on) a cloak is one action, and the time it takes to doff (take off) a cloak is also one action.

## Potions
Potions fulfill a variety of purposes that spells alone cannot accomplish, and the more adventuresome wizards know that having the right potions at hand can be the difference between life and death. Almost every potion must be drunk to receive its effects, but if not, it will be clearly stated.

The below tables connect new potion names to equivalent 5e potion or spell names. Players shouldn't assume that just because there's an equivalent 5e potion or spell, the Harry Potter potion will operate in exactly the same way or have the exact same description.

> ##### Looking at Love Potions
> The morality of love potions is questionable at best. While love potions are often handled humorously in the original series, we must recognize the importance of consent. Love potions do not allow for consent and should not be used to cross any character's boundaries. If you are going to play W&W with love potions, please have a conversation with your table to ensure everyone is comfortable and will behave respectfully. Otherwise, do not include them in your game.

#### Aging Potion 
*Potion, uncommon*
___
When you drink this potion, your age is increased by 4d10 years for 1 hour. This effect authentically changes your age, but doesn't reduce your lifespan or introduce maladies due to aging. One quarter, one half, or three quarters of this potion may be drunk, modifying the effect to 1d10, 2d10, or 3d10.
___
#### Amortentia 
*Love potion, very rare* 
___
When a being drinks this potion, they are overwhelmingly charmed by the brewer of this potion for 1 week. The charmed subject believes the brewer to be their one true love and will perform any request the brewer asks, to the best of their ability. All thoughts will be colored by a powerful obsession with the brewer, but their personality will otherwise be unchanged. This charmed effect can only be removed by an antidote to this potion.
___

*Potion, common*
___
When you drink this potion, every word you try to say comes out as gibberish or complete nonsense for the next 1 minute. 
___
#### Baneberry Poison 
*Poison, common* 
___

## Magical Pets
From owls and rats to toads and cats, </br>Hogwarts students have been helped and </br>hindered by various creature companions. </br>Animals of all shapes and sizes have long </br>been associated with magic. Muggles often </br>called them familiars, and thought them to </br>have supernatural abilities assisting with </br>the practice of magic. The animals owned </br>by Hogwarts students arenât familiars in </br>this sense; they are largely pets, rather than </br>supernatural creatures.

When you select a magical pet, it forms a special connection with you and understands one language you speak. Your magical pet acts independently of you, but it always obeys your verbal commands to the best of its ability. In combat, it rolls its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A magical pet can attack and take other actions as normal. Hogwarts only allows one magical pet per student.
### Owls
The old British superstition that it is unlucky to see owls flying by daylight is readily explained, for when wizards break cover to send messages by day, something dramatic must be afoot in the magical world. As a (mostly) nocturnal bird of prey, the owl is inevitably seen as sinister by Muggles, but they are faithful servants and the most common method used by wizardkind across the world for magical communication.

The advantages of owls as messengers are those very qualities that make them suspicious to Muggles: they operate in the darkness; they have exceptionally well-developed night vision; and are agile and stealthy. Whether because they possess an innate magic or their ancestors have been trained for it, owls learn very quickly and thrive on tracing the witch or wizard for whom their letters are intended.

Trained owls are expensive, and it is quite usual for a wizarding family to share a single owl, or else only use Postal owls. However, when a witch or wizard has their own personal owl, they can enjoy the convenience of sending anyone a letter or package for free.

### Cats
Cats are the creatures most commonly associated with magic. Weâve all seen images of a witch sat on her broomstick accompanied by her black cat. Itâs an association that goes back centuries. In the Salem Witch Trials of 1692, Tituba, one of the first to be accused of witchcraft, was said to have both a black and a red cat. Malleus Maleficarum, the best-known treatise against witchcraft, mentions cats and their untrustworthy nature. As clever and  independent creatures, maybe itâs not surprising that cats have been linked with witches and maligned by ignorant Muggles.

Cats are believed to be the most intelligent companions for witches and wizards, and, depending on the breed (and amount of Kneazle heritage), can often be trained to perform complex tasks, as long as the owner has earned their loyalty.

### Toads
Of the approved animals permitted to students as pets at Hogwarts, the toad is by far the least popular. As a species, toads have as long an association with witchcraft as owls and cats do, but they have gradually appeared less and less frequently as pets at Hogwarts.

History tells us that toads were particularly useful as ingredients in the folk cures practiced in the Dark Ages, and as magical pets, they seem to have a particular link with what were known in 16th century Europe as âcunning folkâ. These were so-called white witches and healers who practised folk medicine using natural ingredients. Ursula Kemp, an English cunning woman and midwife (tried for witchcraft in 1582), was said to have had a black toad called Pygine.

While toads are looked down upon, their usefulness is found in their role as magical guinea pigs. Whether practicing harmless charms or tweaking the effects of minor potions, toads will unprotestingly play the subject of an experiment, easily absorbing liquids through their skin. As long as the magical effect doesnât cause pain, the toad wonât think any less of its owner.

### Alternative Pets
In modern times, Hogwarts is not nearly as strict on studentsâ pets as it has been. Students are allowed a variety of magical pets, with permission obtained prior to the start of the school year. Pets are required to fit within a standard owl cage and have an XX rating or lower by the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.

Pets found in the wizarding world are almost always smarter than their mundane counterparts, thus earning the title of magical pets. No matter what the species, a magical pet will form a bond with its owner and can often serve as an extra set of eyes, alerting their owner when they spot something amiss or locate a familiar person.

# Chapter 6: Wizarding Feats
Some wizards will show a natural aptitude or predilection for certain abilities. Others will dedicate their free time to self-improvement. A small percentage will have rare powers or traits inherited from their ancestors. Regardless of the reason, feats represent a witch or wizard's additional abilities, and all the standard 5e rules apply to obtaining feats.
## Innate Feats
The following feats are defining traits that certain wizards have at birth. These feats must be taken at level 1, through house traits at character creation, and cannot be gained at any other time.
### Giant's Blood
Even though they are few and far between, it's hard for half-giants and part-giants to hide their genealogy; they tend to turn heads wherever they go. With a broad build, impressive strength and a genetic resistance to magic, wizards with giant blood are powerful allies.
* Increase your Strength score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* Adult part-giants are between 7 and 9 feet tall and weigh between 300 and 420 pounds. Your size is Medium.
* You are considered one size larger when determining carrying capacity and weight you can push, drag, or lift.
* When a spell or other magical effect inflicts a condition on you, you can use your reaction to resist one condition of your choice. You canât use this ability again until you finish a long rest.

### Goblin Cunning
The rarest racial combination of all, part-goblins can have goblin ancestry anywhere in their family tree, and it will still make a very noticeable difference. At an average of 4 feet tall, part-goblins may feel out of place in a larger world. However, these small wizards have inherited goblinsâ cleverness and often come with big hearts and big personalities.
* Adult part-goblins are between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh around 110 pounds. Your size is Small.
* You can move through the space of any creature that is of a size larger than yours.
* You have advantage on all Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws against magic.
* You can speak, read, and write Gobbledegook.

> ##### Wizarding Heritage
> Every wizard is human, but wizards are often distinguished by how much magical heritage is in their family tree. Very rarely, wizards will be part-human, inheriting blood and traits from a magical being in their ancestry. Slight prejudices remain around part-human or Muggleborn wizards, but the myths around blood purity have been dispelled.
> ___
> ##### A Witch's Childhood
> Think about how your character's heritage influenced their childhood experiences, and consider how those experiences have shaped your character's personality and worldview.
> 
> **Muggle-borns.** Muggle-borns are wizards and witches born to Muggle parents, non-magical folk. Muggle-borns enter an entirely new world when they receive their letter from Hogwarts. Although theyâll have to adapt to wizarding culture, the lessons theyâve learned from the Muggle world will serve them well and help them see things from a different perspective. Additionally, living in a world without magic means they know how to do things the hard way. 
>
> **Half-bloods.** The vast majority of human wizards are considered half-bloods, wizards that have some combination of magical and Muggle ancestry. Originally used to describe a child of a magical wizard and a non-magical Muggle, half-blood has become an encompassing term. While many half-bloods are raised in the wizarding world, itâs not uncommon for a half-blood to be unaware of their magical side of their family, having a very similar experience to Muggle-borns.
> 
> **Purebloods.** Purebloods come from a long line of wizards and witches, without a drop of Muggle blood in their veins. Raised in wizarding culture, purebloods have grown up riding broomsticks, playing Quidditch in the yard, and hearing the nursery rhymes of Beedle the Bard. Well acquainted with this world, they enter Hogwarts with a little extra confidence.

<!--### Muggle-born
Muggle-borns are wizards and witches born to Muggle parents, non-magical folk. Muggle-borns enter an entirely new world when they receive their letter from Hogwarts. Although theyâll have to adapt to wizarding culture, the lessons theyâve learned from the Muggle world will serve them well and help them see things from a different perspective. Additionally, living in a world without magic means they know how to do things the hard way. 
* Increase your Intelligence score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in Muggle Studies.
* Whenever you make an Intelligence (Muggle Studies) check related to blending in with Muggles or interacting with Muggle technology, add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal bonus.
### Pureblood
Purebloods come from a long line of wizards and witches, without a drop of Muggle blood in their veins. Raised in wizarding culture, purebloods have grown up riding broomsticks, playing Quidditch in the yard, and hearing the nursery rhymes of Beedle the Bard. Well acquainted with this world, they enter Hogwarts with a little extra confidence.
* Increase your Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You gain proficiency in Magical Theory.
* Whenever you make an Intelligence (Magical Theory) check related to wizarding culture or mythology, add double your proficiency bonus to the check, instead of your normal proficiency bonus.-->
### Metamorph Magic
Once in a great many years, a metamorphmagus is born to a wizarding family with their very particular talent: morphing every aspect of their human appearance. Before becoming an adult, a metamorphmagus will not have complete control over this ability, often letting their emotions or stress get the better of them and losing control.
* At will, you can transform your appearance. As an action, you decide what you look like, including your height, weight, facial features, sound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing characteristics, if any. None of your statistics change, you don't appear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic shape stays the same. If you're bipedal, you can't use this spell to become quadrupedal, for instance. At any time, you can use your action to change your appearance in this way again.
* You can also adapt your body to an aquatic environment, growing webbing between your fingers. As an action, you gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

### Parseltongue
Almost exclusively hereditary, to speak Parseltongue is to magically comprehend and verbally communicate with all snakes and snake-like beasts, like the Runespoor and Basilisk. This oral language has been associated with Dark wizards, owing to Salazar Slytherin's status as a Parselmouth which was passed on to the Gaunt family and Tom Riddle. However, outside of Wizarding Britain, no such association exists.
* You can speak Parseltongue.

### Veela Charm
Just like part-giants, itâs very rare to find a part-veela. A wizard or witch who inherited veela blood will almost always be the center of attention, a picture of grace and beauty. Unlike half-veela or quarter-veela, part-veela are just as likely to be male as female.
* You gain proficiency in one Charisma skill of your choice.
* As an action, you can attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within 30 ft, who would be attracted to you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw, (if hostile, with advantage). If it fails, it is charmed by you for one hour or until you or your companions harm it. The charmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance and feels compelled to impress you or receive your attention. After, the creature knows it was charmed by you. You canât use this ability again until you finish a long rest. 

\columnbreak
## Standard Feats
These feats might come from latent natural talent, but are often manifested through hard work and long hours of study. These feats are not restricted to being gained at level 1.
### Aerial Combatant
You're able to keep yourself oriented and lead your targets while flying a broomstick. You gain the following benefits.
* You gain tool proficiency in Vehicles (Broomstick).
* You no longer suffer disadvantage on attack rolls due to flying.

### Detecting Traces
You've learned to feel magic and recognize styles of spells and curses. Using concentration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn the associated spell's school of magic, if any. This ability can penetrate most barriers, but is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or 3 feet of wood or dirt.
### Lycanthropy
You've been attacked by a transformed werewolf, infecting you with the blood curse of lycanthropy. You gain the following benefits.
* Increase your Strength and Constitution scores by 1, to a maximum of 20.
* You have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
___
You also gain the following penalties.
* From sunset to sunrise on the night of the full moon, you undergo your werewolf transformation. During the transformation, your alignment changes to Chaotic Evil and your character is placed under HM control.
* For the day of and three days after your werewolf transformation, you suffer a -3 penalty to your Constitution score, gain two levels of exhaustion that cannot be removed and have disadvantage on Constitution saving throws.
* If your condition becomes known, fellow witches and wizards might fear or discriminate against you.
<div class='footnote'>Part 1 | Wizarding Feats</div>

\pagebreakNum
### Martial Artist
Whether as a childhood extracurricular activity or a supplement to your magical dueling, you're trained in striking and grappling. You gain the following benefits.
* Your unarmed strike uses a d6 for damage.
* When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike on your turn, you can try to grapple the target as a bonus action.
* You have advantage on attack rolls against creatures you are grappling.
* While a creature is grappled by you, you can use your action and make another grapple check to try one of the following maneuvers:
    * **Pin.** If you succeed, you and the creature are both restrained until the grapple ends.
    * **Takedown.** If you succeed, you make an unarmed strike and the creature is knocked prone. 
    * **Disarm.** If you succeed, the creature is forced to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You can choose to take the item, ending the grapple.

### Occlumency Training
You have developed the presence of mind to resist a mental invasion. When targeted by *legilimens*, you make a Wisdom saving throw to resist its initial effects, and you have advantage on the Intelligence contests. If you fail your initial saving throw, you are immediately aware that the spell is targeting you. If you succeed on a saving throw or contest, you can let the spell continue and reveal false information, false emotions, or false memories of your choosing.

Veritaserum will not work on you, unless you allow it.
### Remarkable Aim
You have unerring accuracy with projectile spells. Your ranged spell attacks ignore half cover and treat three-quarters cover as if it were half cover.
### Steady Caster
You're able to maintain focus, even in stressful situations. You have advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to maintain concentration on a spell when you take damage.

\columnbreak
### Vampirism
You gain the following benefits:
* You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You canât discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.
* You are stuck at the age and form you were at the time of your undeath. You can't die of old age, you suffer none of the drawbacks of old age, and you can't be aged magically.
* You gain proficiency in Charisma (Persuasion).

You also gain the following penalties:
* You take 1 damage when you start your turn in direct sunlight.
* You have disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.
* You can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
* You are repelled by the smell of garlic, and touching or eating it causes intense pain.
* Instead of food and water, you must drink animal, human or magical being blood to sustain yourself.

### Wandless Magic
Through studying ancient tomes or channeling some of the volatile magic of your youth, you're able to perform small magical feats without your wand. If you know any of the following spells, you can cast them without needing a wand or somatic component: *accio*, *alohomora*, *colovaria*, *illegibilus*, *incendio glacia*, *pereo*, *wingardium leviosa*.

You cannot expend a higher level spell slot when casting in this way.

<h1 id="chapter-7-wizarding-skills" style='width:50%;'>Chapter 7: Wizarding Skills</h1>

Due to the nature of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, unique skills are needed in a wizard's daily life. Some of the traditional 5e skills are not intended for use with this supplement and have been listed below as deprecated. To replace them, new wizarding skills have been added to cover the variety of subjects taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Even when there's a direct conversion from old to new, applications are distinct from 5e descriptions.

## New Skills
### Intelligence (Herbology)
Your Intelligence (Herbology) check measures your ability to recall lore about mundane or magical plants.
### Intelligence (Magical Theory)
Your Intelligence (Magical Theory) check measures your comprehension of the workings of magic and spell invention. It also checks whether you can recall lore about the invention of spells, legendary wizards and witches, wizarding mythology, and historical events in the wizarding world.
### Intelligence (Muggle Studies)
An Intelligence (Muggle Studies) check tests your familiarity with Muggle culture, history, arts and sciences, your success when trying to blend in with Muggles, and your ability to understand or interact with Muggle technology.
### Wisdom (Magical Creatures)
When there is any question whether you can calm down a magical creature or intuit a non-magical animalâs intentions, that would call for a Wisdom (Magical Creatures) check. You also make a Wisdom (Magical Creatures) check to keep your head around dangerous creatures and recall their lore.
### Wisdom (Potion-Making)
Your Wisdom (Potion-Making) check is used whenever trying to understand and apply alchemical ingredients' effects, stir a brewing potion in just the right way, or experiment and uncover secret potion-making techniques.
<div style='margin-top:20px;'></div>

> ##### Interacting with Magic
> If a character interacts with a complex piece of magic requiring theoretical knowledge, it might call for an Intelligence (Magical Theory). However, the majority of interactions with magic should use a character's spellcasting ability modifier.

<!-- # Chapter 8: Wizarding Alignment
Besides, the world isnât split into good people and Death Eaters. Weâve all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. Thatâs who we really are.â - Sirius Black, Order of the Phoenix
## Good vs. Dark
Throughout the history of wizardkind, skillful wizards have sought to kill and control their way to power, much like certain muggles. These infamous individuals are labeled Dark wizards and Dark witches, for utilizing malicious forms of magic and using their power to inflict pain and suffering.

Whether from morbid curiosity, academic dedication, or personal ambition, there are countless Dark secrets researched and recorded in the wizarding world. Even at Hogwarts, extremely Dark magic can be found within the restricted section of the library. While the magic itself is dangerous and often ill-intentioned, magic is but a tool. Almost any spell can be used for Dark purposes, if the caster seeks to harm others. The reason the incantations and rituals of extremely Dark magic is viewed differently is partly because of the sadistic design of that magic and because of the horrors that will transpire if it falls into the wrong hands.

### Lawful Dark, Neutral Dark, and Chaotic Dark
Alignment itself works in a very similar way to 5e's alignment, with one slight change. The word evil is replaced by the word Dark. This speaks less to the morality of your principles and more to the morality of your actions. For instance, the motto of "For the Greater Good" rings of noble aspirations, but if the means to that end are violent and filled with Dark magic, the appropriate alignment is Dark.

Let's suppose a witch were to study and wield Dark magic for the purpose of good. She might only cast Unforgivable Curses against Dark wizards who do so first, or use her power to protect innocents. Even with those pure intentions, the means by which she attains her power will inevitably cause pain and death, even if it's only those who have used magic for pain and death themselves. The nature of Dark magic draws upon hatred and fear. This witch would be motivated by revenge, and it would be a very narrow path to walk. Her alignment would likely be Chaotic Neutral

# Chapter 8: Dark Magic Corruption
Besides, the world isnât split into good people and Death Eaters. Weâve all got both light and dark inside of us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. Thatâs who we really are.â *- Sirius Black, Order of the Phoenix.* 
</br>Â Â Â Â Â Â As a wizard delves into the foul tomes of Dark magic, changes will begin to take place. Experimenting with Dark magic almost always results from an unquenchable thirst for power, an incredibly intense fear or a deep well of hatred. By using twisted magic and committing unspeakable acts, that inner darkness takes a toll on a Dark witch's physical and mental well-being.
### Gaining Corruption Points
Although a wizard's descent into darkness is gradual, their life is usually marked by definitive moments when the line is finally crossed. Murder, betrayal, and twisted experiments are common in the histories of Dark wizards and witches.

Whenever a character commits an act that represents their growing cruelty, the HM can call for a Wisdom saving throw. The DC of the saving throw is determined by their corruption tier in the table below. If the character fails that saving throw, they gain a single corruption point. Some examples of events that might prompt a corruption roll are:

* Killing a being by reducing it to 0 hit points with a Dark spell, when it could've been spared
* Casting an Unforgivable Curse, whether anyone witnesses it or not
* Betraying an ally that trusted you, for your own gain
* Harming innocents in a foreseeable and preventable way
* Manipulating someone into abandoning their morals
* Acting in a way contrary to alignment

As a character reaches higher corruption tiers, the DC of the saving throw increases. Additionally, the higher tiers grant a corruption boon and inflict a corruption effect on the character. Upon reaching a corruption tier with an effect, the character must roll the appropriate die to determine which effect they receive from the corruption effect tables on the next page. If appropriate, the HM and the character's player can also come to an agreement on which corruption effect a character receives. These effects are cumulative with the effects of lower tiers of corruption. 

These effects are intended to slightly shape a character's personality and action. Roleplaying how the Dark magic is twisting the character is strongly encouraged, and an HM may remind players of their corruption effects.


<div class="wide" style="margin-top:5px;margin-bottom:10px;">

##### Corruption Tiers
| | Pure-Hearted </br>(0 points) | Pragmatic </br>(1-4 points) | Devious </br>(5-7 points) | Vicious </br>(8-11 points) | Vile </br>(12+ points) |

### Removing Corruption Points
The only way to remove corruption is through true, meaningful remorse. Typically, someone must feel remorse for the specific actions that caused the corruption in the first place, but the remorse can also be more general, based on an entire life of wrongdoing. There must be an amount of suffering that is comparable to the suffering inflicted on others.

Based on the actions and inner thoughts of the character, the HM decides if a character is able to remove a corruption point. The factors required for true remorse might be:
* Acknowledging responsibility for the harm caused
* Feeling a deep sadness and regret over the actions
* Seeking to make amends in whatever way possible

If enough corruption points are removed to reach a lower tier, the boon and effect from the previous higher tier are also removed.

<div class='footnote'>Part 1 | Wizarding Alignment</div>

\pagebreakNum
### Corruption Boons
Â Â Â Â ***Empowered Darkness.*** When you have Empowered Spell as one of your metamagic options and use it on a Dark spell, it costs 0 sorcery points.

***Heightened Darkness.*** You can use the Heightened Spell metamagic when casting a Dark spell, whether it's one of your metamagic options or not. When you use Heightened Spell on a Dark spell, it costs 1 sorcery point.

***Inferi Ritual.*** By focusing for 10 minutes and expending a 5th level spell slot, this ritual creates an undead servant. Choose a corpse of a Medium or Small humanoid you can touch. Your spell imbues the target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an inferius (the HM has the creatureâs stats).

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any of your inferi if one is within 60 feet of you (if you control multiple, you can command any or all with the same command). You decide its action and movement during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.

The Dark magic that binds the corpse is permanent. The inferius will only deanimate if you die or if it is destroyed.
### Corruption Effects

<div style='column-count:2; margin-top:20px;'>

| <span style="padding:10px;">d6</span> | Mild Effects|
|:-:|:------------|
| 1 | Hoarder |
| 2 | Compulsive |
| 3 | Cough |
| 4 | Reckless |
| 5 | Scent of Decay |
| 6 | Mildly Phobic |

| <span style="padding:10px;">d8</span> | Severe Effects |
|:-:|:---------|
| 1 | Phobic |
| 2 | Jittery |
| 3 | Unnatural Pallor |
| 4 | Paranoid |
| 5 | Crimson Pupils |
| 6 | Distracted |
| 7 | Hallucinations |
| 8 | Sadistic |
</div>

Â Â Â Â ***Compulsive.*** You begin to exhibit a mild, compulsive ritual of the HM's choice, likely associated with some fear. This can manifest as quadruple-checking locks and defensive measures, inspecting behind curtains, doors, and bushes for hidden attackers, or refusing to consume anything until you can get a small animal to test it for poison, for example. You take 1.5 times as long to complete a short rest.

***Cough.*** You develop an uncontrollable cough that creeps up every now and then. You have disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.

***Crimson Pupils.*** Your eyes are bloodshot and in the right lighting, even the blackest part of your pupils seem to shine red. You have disadvantage on attack rolls when you are facing the sun or a bright light.

***Distracted.*** Your mind has grown scattered and easily clouded. You have disadvantage on Intelligence ability checks, except for Intelligence saving throws. 

***Hallucinations.*** Strange visions and sourceless whispers occasionally tug at your perception. You have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks.

***Hoarder.*** You are compelled to collect anything that might be remotely useful in protecting you from your greatest fears. Appropriate items stumbled upon must be gathered and carried, if able, until at carrying capacity.

***Jittery.*** You become far too easy to spook or startle. You have disadvantage on initiative rolls.

***Mildly Phobic.*** You begin to obsess over a specific creature or person, believing them to be the cause of your demise. During the first round of combat with a creature of the chosen type, you are frightened.

***Paranoid.*** You no longer trust the people you meet. You do not count as a "friendly" creature to strangers and acquaintances, and they do not count as "friendly" to you, in regards to abilities or spells. You can only target yourself and your closest allies with your beneficial spells and abilities.

***Phobic.*** A specific creature or person invades your dreams, turning them to nightmares. When you enter combat with a creature of the chosen type, you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC is 10 + your total corruption points). On a failure, you are frightened of them for 1 minute.

***Reckless.*** You've become impulsive in the face of dangerous situations. The first attack made against you in any combat encounter has advantage on the attack roll.

***Sadistic.*** Your bloodlust makes you become entranced by the pain you cause. Whenever you deal damage, the next attack made against you by anything other than the creature you damaged has advantage on the attack roll.

***Scent of Decay.*** Your body emits a faint stench of death. You have disadvantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks.

***Unnatural Pallor.*** Your skin has become pale and waxy and your features oddly distorted. You have disadvantage on Charisma ability checks, except for Charisma (Intimidation) and Charisma saving throws.
### Restricted Dark Spells
The following spells simply cannot be cast by your average wizard. They require a more intimate understanding of the darker sides of magic. The Cruciatus Curse is specifically fueled by the desire to inflict pain and the Killing Curse requires pure, unadulterated hatred to end a person's life. Neither of these will have a fraction of the effect without the proper feeling behind it.

| Spell Name  | Required Corruption Points |
|:-----------------:|:--:|
| *transmogrify*    | 2  |
| *crucio*          | 4  |
| *azreth*          | 7  |
| *avada kedavra*   | 11 |

Once you've reached the required number of corruption points, you are now able to add that spell to your list of known spells through the usual methods of learning a spell. Once you add a restricted Dark spell to your spell list, you can keep that spell, even if your corruption points return to a number lower than the required amount.

# Chapter 9: Spells
Magic in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter works in a very fluid and flexible way, limited only by a wizard's knowledge and experience. Some spells are entirely dependent on feeling a specific emotion, while others require mental focus and precise wand movements. Spellcasting is a very personal thing, giving different witches their own signature styles and repertoires.

Because Wands & Wizards focuses exclusively on spellcasters, some extra attention has been given to how spells work. Not every spell can kill, which allows wizards and witches to engage in the non-lethal combat expected by wizarding society. Pay extra attention to the Spell Tags listed in the spell descriptions.
## Spellcasting
### Damaging Spells
Many spells deal some kind of damage to the target. However, because magic is deeply linked to a specific spellâs intent, the effect on the target can vary greatly. Spells can either be lethal or non-lethal. Many dueling spells are designed to be non-lethal, but violent, combative Dark magic will kill.

#### Non-Lethal Magic
A creature cannot be killed by standard spells, no matter the intent of the caster. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a standard spell (and if applicable, fails all of their death saving throws), that creature will be knocked out, non-lethally.
#### Lethal Magic
Dark spells differ from regular spells in one important way: damage dealt by Dark spells is potentially lethal. If a creature is reduced to 0 hit points by a Dark spell (and if applicable, fails all of their death saving throws), that creature dies. It is possible to use damaging Dark spells to injure a creature, and then finish them off with a damaging spell that isnât Dark, to non-lethally incapacitate it.
### Duration
Wands & Wizards maintains all of the standard 5e rules and conventions regarding spell duration and concentration, but the addition of dedication spells requires more strategic use of a handful of spells. 

<div class='footnote'>Part 2 | Spells</div>

\pagebreakNum
#### Dedication
If a spell is marked as a dedication spell in its Duration entry, you must maintain concentration on that spell and use an action at the start of each of your turns to maintain your dedication. If you lose dedication, the spell ends. 
Like concentration, you can end dedication at any time (no action).

The following factors can break dedication:
- **Casting another spell.** It doesn't matter if the other spell requires dedication or not. Even if you use your bonus action to cast another spell, your dedication is lost.
- **Losing your line of sight to your target.** This only applies if your spell affects a specific target. You cannot lose dedication by losing line of sight to area spells. 
- **Losing concentration.** If your concentration is broken by taking damage or being incapacitated, your dedication is broken.
### Spell Tags
#### Dark
The Dark Arts, also known as Dark magic, refers to any type of magic that is mainly used to cause harm to, exert control over, or even kill the victim. The Dark Arts encompass many spells and actions ranging from the powerful Unforgivable Curses to brewing harmful or poisonous potions and breeding Dark creatures, all of which are often illegal or at least discouraged. Practicing certain Dark magics is rumored to damage the wizardâs very soul, and require some sort of malicious intent in order to cast. However, despite being labelled âdark,â the Dark Arts are not necessarily âevil.â Many prominent wizards and Aurors have been known to rely on Dark spells to carry out their duty, in dire circumstances.

Because of their lethal effects, the use of Dark spells on beings will surely gain your character some attention and may cause people to question that characterâs motivations and loyalties. If the Dark tag is accompanied by Unforgivable, this is an Unforgivable Curse, illegal under all circumstances and guaranteed to be punished with a life sentence in Azkaban. Casting Unforgivable Curses or killing a being with a Dark spell should prompt a corruption roll, as outlined in Chapter 8: Dark Magic Corruption.
#### Defensive
Defensive magic is a classification of charms, jinxes, and other types of spells that are specifically focused on nullifying and countering magic. Shield charms, anti-apparition jinxes, and countercurses are just a few examples of defensive magic. Nearly every wizard will rely on Defensive spells at some point in their life, but some wizards will be particularly in tune with this aspect of magic, favoring spells of this type.
#### School of Magic
A school of magic spell is a spell that cannot be learned via the usual methods. These spells cannot be chosen upon leveling up, but instead is granted by a school of magic whenever you gain a spell slot of that spell's level. Once you gain a school of magic spell, it's added to your spells known, it doesnât count against your number of spells known, and it cannot be forgotten to learn another spell.

### Targets
#### Being
A Being is one of the three classifications used by the Ministry of Magic to catalogue the various magical Creatures that inhabit the wizarding world (the others being Beast and Spirit). The definition of a Being is any creature that has sufficient intelligence to understand the laws of the magical community and to bear part of the responsibility in shaping those laws.

All humans are beings, as are goblins, vampires, hags, giants, house-elves, veela, werewolves, merpeople and centaurs. Dementors, boggarts and poltergeists are neither Beings nor Beasts, as they are Non-Beings.
#### Beast
A Beast is any living thing that is does not fit the criteria of a Being. Wild animals and all the creatures students learn about in Care of Magical Creatures are classified as Beasts. Some creatures appear to fit the qualifications that define Being (intelligent speech), such as Acromantulas, Sphinxes, Manticores, and Erklings. These have not been offered Being status due to their extremely violent and even lethal tendencies, which interferes with their role in a lawful society. They are thus classified as Beasts.

<div class='footnote'>Part 2 | Spells</div>

\pagebreakNum
#### Object
An object is quite simply that, an inanimate object. Donât let movement, imitations of life or even intelligent speech deceive you; there are many enchantments and bewitched objects out there in the magical world that can make an inanimate object quite animate. Never trust something that thinks if you donât see a place for its brain.
#### Spirit
The Spirit classification was formed when ghosts complained that it was insensitive to classify them as âbeings,â when they were so clearly âhas-beens.â Theyâve often been dissatisfied with governments focusing more on the matters of the living than on the matters of the dead.
## Unique Spells
### Apparition
Apparition is the method by which many adult witches and wizards choose to travel from place to place. When one apparates, they turn on the spot, "feeling [their] way into nothingness," and vanish from their present location to reappear a second later in a new location, accompanied by a loud cracking or popping sound.

Apparition, much like muggle driving, requires the individual take an exam to acquire a license at the age of 17.  To prepare, 16-year-olds can take lessons in apparition, usually by practicing short jumps of only a few feet in the presence of an instructor. This is because the process can be dangerous; if the witch or wizard does not have the proper focus when they apparate, they may leave a part of themselves behind.
#### How to Apparate
In order to apparate, you must have a proficiency bonus of +4 or greater; the process demands a certain level of magical skill that is beyond younger witches and wizards. 

Though apparition is not technically a spell, it taxes the body much like a spell, and requires you to expend a spell slot. Longer distances require more power and higher level spell slots. Apparition also requires a wand.
<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

| Slot Level | Apparition Range |
|:---:|:------------|
| 1st | 10 ft |
| 2nd | 50 ft |
| 3rd | 200 ft |
| 4th | 1,000 ft |
| 5th | 1 mile |
| 6th | 5 miles |
| 7th | 20 miles |
| 8th | 100 miles |
| 9th | 500 miles |

As an action, you can attempt to disapparate. Make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. Other modifiers may add to or subtract from your total. The final result determines if you arrive successfully. If you do, you immediately apparate in an unoccupied space within the distance allowed by the spell slot you expended, automatically compensating for any creatures or objects that may be in your intended space. Because apparition is not a spell, it cannot be countered.

**Leisurely Departure.** For most adults, apparition is a straight-forward process to get to work, run errands or even go downstairs, and there are no immediate threats distracting you. Some good reasons for not having a leisurely departure are: being under fire, being in the presence of a particularly terrifying creature, or suffering significant wounds (missing half your hit points). Leisurely departure is decided by the HM and grants advantage on your apparition ability check.
<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

| Ability Check | Apparition Result |
|:----:|:-------|
| 15 or higher | You disapparate properly and arrive safely. |
| 11-14 | You disapparate but arrive off-target (d20). |
| 7-10 | The disapparition feels off and you stop yourself. Nothing happens. |
| 5-6 | You suffer a minor splinch and arrive off-target (d20). |
| 4 or lower  | You suffer a major splinch and arrive off-target (d100). |

<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

#### Destination, Determination, Deliberation
You must visualize your destination when you attempt to apparate. Typically, this means a wizard can only apparate to a location they've been to before and can clearly remember. Apparating to a new location that is in close proximity to a known location may be possible, but may remove the benefit of leisurely departure or even apply disadvantage to the ability check. How difficult it is to apparate to your desired destination is decided by the HM.

**Off-Target.** If you apparate off-target, you appear a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. Distance off-target is determined by a die roll that gives you the percent of the distance that was to be traveled (i.e. if you meant to travel 120 miles, and rolled a 15, you would be 15% of 120 miles off target, or 18 miles). Depending on the severity of your error, the dice used may be a d20 or d100. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face.

**Wandless Apparition.** Apparating without a wand is far more difficult and dangerous than other wandless magic, which is already rarely practiced. To attempt to apparate without a wand, you must have the Wandless Magic feat, you cannot gain the benefit of a leisurely departure, you have disadvantage on the ability check, and you must expend a spell slot two levels higher than the slot you normally would expend.

#### Side-Along Apparition
When you apparate, you may bring along a number of creatures equal to your spellcasting ability modifier. Every passenger imposes a -2 penalty on your apparition roll. Each creature must be holding on to either you or another creature that is also holding on to you, and you must make a separate apparition ability check for each creature with the same total side-along penalty and the same advantage or disadvantage. This roll only determines whether or not that creature is splinched. Normal splinching rules apply.

**Forced Side-Along Apparition.** If a creature is grappling you when you disapparate, they side-along apparate with you and you have disadvantage on the roll, in addition to the side-along penalty from the additional passenger. If an enemy creature is within 5 feet of you when you disapparate, they can use their reaction to attempt to grapple you before you vanish.

#### Splinching
When you are splinched, you've left a part of yourself behind at your previous location, instead of apparating your entire body. Usually, splinching is a result of not having the proper determination while apparating. How much of you is left behind is determined by whether you had a minor or major splinch.

A minor splinch is when the lost body part is generally non-threatening; perhaps an eyebrow, a part of your finger, or a small section of skin. You determine how much slashing damage you suffer by rolling a single d10. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way.

A major splinch is far more severe and often life threatening. You lose a large body part, such as a leg or arm, or a piece of flesh is ripped from your body. Roll a number of d6 dice equal to your level. You suffer that much slashing damage and a level of exhaustion. This damage cannot be reduced or prevented in any way. At the start of your following turns, you take slashing damage equal to half your level as you bleed out, which ends as soon as you receive hit points from a healing effect.


If you are splinched, the HM will roll on the appropriate table to determine the result. If you lose flesh, the HM can either determine the location arbitrarily, or you can agree on an appropriate spot. For example, if you were being grabbed by an enemy on your right arm, the splinch would likely have occurred there.
<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

| d6 | Minor Splinch Result |
|:--:|:-------|
| 1 | You lose a part of a finger. |
| 2 | You lose a toe. |
| 3 | You lose a piece of one of your ears. |
| 4 | You lose a small piece of skin. |
| 5 | You lose one of your eyebrows. |
| 6 | You lose an article of clothing. |
<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>

| d6 | Major Splinch Result |
|:---:|:---------------|
| 1-2 | You lose part of a leg. |
| 3 | You lose an arm. |
| 4-6 | You lose a large amount of flesh. |
<div style="margin-top:40px;"></div>


### Legilimency and Occlumency
Legilimency is the incredibly rare practice of using magic to pull information from an individual's mind. While this mysterious art often goes unnoticed, there are a select few people who have prepared themselves to resist this magic, called occlumens. The cerebral battle between a legilimens and an occlumens is a direct contest of discipline. An occlumens must keep their mind clear in an almost meditative state, while a legilimens must probe and test to find a weakness in those mental defenses. 

<div class='footnote'>Part 2 | Spells</div>

\pagebreakNum

If a target of the *legilimens* spell has the Occlumency Training feat, their training gives them the chance to make a Wisdom saving throw to immediately resist the intrusion into their mind. Additionally, that occlumens is experienced in the techniques used to throw a person out of their mind and has advantage on the Intelligence contests between them and the legilimens. If the target has the Skilled Occlumens school of magic feature, their mental defenses are flawless. A legilimens cannot even read their surface thoughts and the spell has no effect on them.

Those trained in occlumency have one more trick up their sleeve. If they resist the effects of the *legilimens* spell, they have the choice of immediately ending the spell or fabricating anything of their choosing to show to the legilimens. The legilimens has no way of detecting that the information is any different from the target's true inner thoughts. As a legilimens probes deeper, the occlumens can invent more and more intricate details, constructing false memories and giving misleading information.

### Patronus Casting
The patronus charm is a special bit of magic that requires a wizard to envision one of their happiest memories while casting the spell. If the feeling of happiness is not genuine or not strong enough, the casting attempt will fail. In its most basic form, successfully casting the spell results in a non-corporeal patronus charm, which looks like a beam or ball of bluish-white light being emitted from the casterâs wand. A more advanced form of the charm is the corporeal patronus, which is when that glowing essence forms into the shape of an animal or magical beast. The corporeal shape of a patronus is a reflection of the witchâs soul and is often quite intimate.

A wizardâs corporeal patronus is also the animal that they will transform into during their animagus transformation. The first time you cast *expecto patronum* or complete your animagus transformation, use Appendix B: Patronus Rolling Tables to determine its shape. At your HM's discretion, you can select your desired patronus instead of rolling for it.
## Spell Conversions
Although the spells of Harry Potter have incredible effects, some share similiarities with existing 5e spells. The below tables connect new spell names to equivalent 5e spell names. Because each spell is designed around the effects within the Wizarding World, almost every spell is modified in some way. Players shouldn't assume that just because there's an equivalent 5e spell, the Harry Potter spell will operate in exactly the same way or have the exact same description.

More than one new spell can correspond to a single 5e spell, and the opposite applies if a new spell contains the function of multiple 5e spells. If a spell is not listed in the following tables, it means it is an entirely new spell and does not have a 5e equivalent.

\pagebreakNum
#### [Avada Kedavra](#spell-list)
<span id="spell-descr-Avada-Kedavra"></span>
*The Killing Curse - 8th-level Curse*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Tags:** Dark - *Unforgivable Curse*
___
The most dangerous of the Unforgivables, Avada Kedavra channels the caster's pure hatred into an unblockable spell that kills whatever it strikes. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. On a hit and if the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it dies or is destroyed. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. Defensive spells have no effect against this spell and it can only be blocked by physical objects.

The conjured birds are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned swarms as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. 

The HM has the creatures' statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell slots, more creatures appear - twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.
#### [Azreth](#spell-list)
<span id="spell-descr-Azreth"></span>
*Fiendfyre - 7th-level Curse*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (10 foot cube)
- **Duration:** Dedication, up to 42 seconds
- **Tags:** Dark
___
Great plumes of cursed fire pour out from the tip of your wand, rampaging into shapes of beasts and incinerating anything in their path. Upon casting, the area of the fiendfyre is one 10-foot cube, with the number of 10-foot cubes doubling at the beginning of each of your turns. As long as concentration is maintained, you can arrange any newly added cubes as you wish. Each cube must have at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature takes the same damage when it enters the area for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.

Upon reaching 8 cubes, you must make a DC15 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration at the beginning of each of your turns. If your concentration is broken after 4 cubes of fiendfyre are active, the spell doesn't end and rages out of control. The fiendfyre will continue to double at the beginning of each round, until the end of its duration. If you decide to end the spell while you still have concentration, the spell ends as normal and all fiendfyre disappears.

The fiendfyre damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects that arenât being worn or carried. Even magical objects and defenses are damaged or destroyed by this spell.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d10 and the concentration DC increases by 1 for each slot level above 7th.
#### [Bombarda](#spell-list)

*The Exploding Charm - Curse cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
- **Tags:** Dark
___
The spell blasts whatever it hits, creating a localized concussive explosion upon impact. Make a ranged spell attack against a target within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d10 bludgeoning damage.

This spellâs damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10), and 17th level (4d10).
#### [Brackium Emendo](#spell-list)
<span id="spell-descr-Brackium-Emendo"></span>
*The Bone Mending Spell - 4th-level Healing*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
This spell heals a being's broken bones immediately, although the process is quite painful. A being you can see that you tap with your wand regains a number of hit points equal to 5d10 + your spellcasting ability modifier, and gains a level of exhaustion.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.
#### [Cantis](#spell-list)
<span id="spell-descr-Cantis"></span>
*The Singing Jinx - Curse cantrip*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** 1 round
___
When struck by this spell, a being can't help but belt out a couple of lines from the first song that comes to mind. Make a ranged spell attack against a being within range. On a hit, the target must cast all other spells non-verbally until the end of its next turn. If it tries to cast a spell verbally, it must first succeed on an Intelligence saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

If the caster or target doesn't move or would easily resist the force of the other being pulled, the other moves 20 feet. If the target is an unwilling creature that is able to be moved, it must make a Strength saving throw to resist being moved. The bond of light keeps the caster and target attached for the duration.

*The Confundus Charm - 4th-level Charm (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
The Confundus Charm is a particularly powerful charm that leaves anything confused, forgetful, and impressionable, often causing people to wander off absent-mindedly. If the target is an object you can see within range that operates or functions on its own, it will operate erratically, malfunction, or completely shut down. This spell has no effect on a completely inanimate objects that entirely depend on external manipulation.

If the target is a creature you can see within range, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it. An affected target canât take reactions and, if not distracted with something, you roll a d10. If you roll 1-8, the creature must use all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, assign a direction to each number 1-8. If you roll a 9-10, the creature doesn't move. Whether it moves or not, the creature doesnât take an action this turn.

If desired, you can suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) at the time of casting and magically influence a creature you can see within range that can hear and understand you. Creatures that canât be charmed are immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to directly hurt itself or its allies will have no effect. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire duration. You can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration. For example, you might suggest that a wizard hug the next blast-ended skrewt he sees. If the condition isnât met before the spell expires, the activity isnât performed.

At the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the spell's effects end for that target.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can target one additional target for each slot level above 4th. The targets must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.

___
With a single word and a heart full of hatred, waves of intense pain assail one creature you can see within range. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is subject to crippling pain. Otherwise, the spell has no effect on it.

While the target is affected by crippling pain, any speed it has can be no higher than 10 feet. The target also has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, other than Constitution saving throws. Finally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.

A target suffering this pain must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a failed save, the target gains one level of exhaustion.

- **Duration:** Instantaneous
___
You choose a portion of dirt or stone that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You manipulate it in one of the following ways:

* If you target an area of stone or earth, you can instantaneously excavate it, move it along the ground, and deposit it up to 5 feet away. This movement doesnât have enough force to cause damage.
* If the dirt or stone you target is on the ground, you cause it to become difficult terrain. Alternatively, you can cause the ground to become normal terrain if it is already difficult terrain. This change lasts for 1 hour. If cast multiple times, only two of this effect can be active at a time, and you can dismiss such an effect as a bonus action.

- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes
___
A particularly intimidating display of transfiguration, this spell turns a desk-sized object into a miniature version of an adult dragon. Choose either one or two inanimate, nonmagical objects you can see within range that each fill a 5-foot cube and choose one of the following options: 

* One dragon wyrmling of challenge rating 4 or lower 
* Two dragon wyrmlings of challenge rating 2 or lower 

The object becomes a Medium-sized dragon construct with the chosen wyrmling's statistics, which is untransfigured when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends.

The dragon construct is friendly to you and your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the dragon construct, which has its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required by you). If you don't issue any commands to it, it defends itself from hostile creatures, but otherwise takes no actions.

If your concentration is broken, the dragon construct doesn't disappear. Instead, you lose control of the construct, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled dragon construct can't be dismissed by you, and it untransfigures 10 minutes after you transfigured it.

The HM has the creature's statistics.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level, choose one of the following options:

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
___
You conjure up a swirling sphere of water with a 5-foot radius at a point you can see within range. The sphere can hover but no more than 10 feet off the ground. The sphere remains for the spellâs duration.

Any creature in the sphereâs space must make a Strength saving throw. On a successful save, a creature is ejected from that space to the nearest unoccupied space of the creatureâs choice outside the sphere. A Huge or larger creature succeeds on the saving throw automatically, and a Large or smaller creature can choose to fail it. On a failed save, a creature is restrained by the sphere and is engulfed by the swirling bubble of water. At the end of each of its turns, a restrained target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

The sphere can restrain as many as four Medium or smaller creatures or one Large creature. If the sphere restrains a creature that causes it to exceed this capacity, a random creature that was already restrained by the sphere falls out of it and lands prone in a space within 5 feet of it.
<div class='footnote'>Part 2 | Spells</div>

\pagebreakNum

As an action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in a straight line. If it moves over a pit, a cliff, or other drop-off, it safely descends until it is hovering 10 feet above the ground. Any creature restrained by the sphere moves with it. You can ram the sphere into creatures, forcing them to make the saving throw.

When the spell ends, the sphere falls to the ground and extinguishes all normal flames within 30 feet of it. Any creature restrained by the sphere is knocked prone in the space where it falls. The water then vanishes.

You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that isnât being worn or carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has no effect.

The target's size doubles in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one category - from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn't enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target's items and equipment also grow to match its new size. While enlarged, the target deals 1d4 extra damage.

If concentration is maintained for one whole round, the creature perceives everything as hilariously funny and falls into fits of laughter if this spell affects it. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or fall prone, becoming incapacitated and unable to stand up for the duration. A creature with an Intelligence score of 5 or less isnât affected.

At the end of each of its turns, and each time it takes damage, the target can make another Wisdom saving throw. The target has advantage on the saving throw if itâs triggered by damage. On a success, the spell ends.

*The Patronus Charm - 3rd-level Charm (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 10 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Tags:** Defensive
___
A Patronus Charm is a special bit of magic that requires a wizard to envision one of their happiest memories while casting the spell. The feeling of happiness must be genuine or strong enough to produce a radiant, ethereal beast, the embodiment of that wizard's positive emotions that serves as their protector.

When you cast this spell, you can choose to conjure an incorporeal or corporeal patronus. If you attempt to cast this spell while frightened or within 60 feet of a dementor, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the number of dementors within 60 feet of you. A roll of 19-20 on the die automatically succeeds.

On a success, you cast the spell. On a failure, you can only conjure an incorporeal patronus, but if you fail the check by 5 or more, the spell fails entirely.
<div class='footnote'>Part 2 | Spells</div>

\pagebreakNum

At the end of your turn, if you are frightened or there are one or more dementors within 60 feet of you while concentrating on this spell, you must repeat the ability check. On a failure, your patronus vanishes and the spell ends.

<div style="margin-top:20px;"></div>

> ##### Highly Advanced Magic
> The Patronus Charm is regarded as a difficult spell partly because the caster must relive a truly joyful memory when casting. This spell's ability check is unusual, but represents the challenge of focusing on suitable memory in a stressful situation. 
>
> Remember that a frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks, including this one. Your HM can allow you to spend Inspiration to automatically succeed on this check. Your character might bring forth a powerful childhood memory in their time of need.

<div style="margin-top:20px;"></div>

A patronus sheds light in a radius around it. You and friendly creatures can't be frightened while in your patronus's light. A dementor that starts its turn within this light or enters the light for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of the patronus until the start of its next turn (this fear ignores any immunity to the frightened condition). While frightened, the dementor must take the Dash action on its turn and move away from the patronus by the safest available route until it leaves the light.

**Incorporeal Patronus.** Your patronus takes the form of a 5-foot burst of glowing mist in an unoccupied space adjacent to you. The patronus doesn't fill its space. It sheds bright light in its space and dim light in a 5-foot radius. On subsequent turns, you can move the patronus to another space adjacent to you as a bonus action. Additionally, you can move it as a reaction to a dementor moving within 10 feet of you.

**Corporeal Patronus.** Your patronus takes the form of a wispy silver animal in an unoccupied space that you can see within range. The patronus doesn't fill its space. It has no hit points and is immune to all damage, but can be targeted by another spell that affects magic, such as *finite incantatem*. The patronus sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.

<div style="margin-top:20px;"></div>

> ##### More than Dementors
> The Patronus Charm is most famous against dementors, but it can be a potent protector against other dark creatures in the Wizarding World.
>
> Only dementors and lethifolds have been confirmed to be affected by a patronus. At the HM's discretion, your patronus can interact with or harm creatures like banshees, inferi, or obscuri. If your HM decides a creature can be affected by a patronus, the creature is susceptible to the patronus's fear effect, attacks and damage.
> 
> Even if a patronus is unable to harm a particular kind of creature, its soothing presence can still protect you by preventing fear.

When you cast the spell and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can move the patronus. The distance you can move it depends on the size of the patronus. A Medium or smaller patronus can move 60 feet, a Large patronus can move 45 feet, and a Huge patronus can move 30 feet. A patronus ignores objects and terrain. In addition, the Patronus can enter a creature's space and stop there.

At any time during the patronus's movement, you can direct the patronus to charge into a dementor within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the patronus using your spell attack modifier. On a hit, the target takes 5d10 radiant damage and the patronus pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The patronus moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it and does not use any movement to do so.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 and the radius of the dim light increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.

You choose yourself or one person within the area of the spell to be the Secret-Keeper. If the Secret-Keeper tells someone the secret (the location of the dwelling) verbally or in writing, that person can see the secret like the Secret-Keeper and step onto the property. It's impossible for anyone other than the Secret-Keeper to share the secret. If the Secret-Keeper dies, everyone who knows the secret becomes Secret-Keepers and can share the secret with others.

Three dimensional space is warped around the secret, as if the space occupied by the secret never existed. If a person walks directly towards the secret, they will magically appear on the other side. Nothing will remain that indicates or gives clues to the existence of the secret. If anyone knew the location of the secret before the spell is cast, they forget the exact address but remember the general area where the secret is located.

This spell is completely undetectable and the area can't be targeted by divination spells. The spell's effects will only end if you dispel it or all Secret-Keepers have died.

You can use this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of action, such as âAttack that creature,â âRun over there,â or âFetch that object.â If the creature completes the order and doesnât receive further direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.

You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesnât do anything that you donât allow it to do. During this time you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.

If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit points, it isn't knocked unconscious.

The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.

The target's gear melds into the new form. The creature can't activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.

<span id="spell-descr-Legilimens"></span>
*The Legilimency Spell - 3rd-level Divination*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Tags:** School of Magic - *Divination*
___
With legilimency, a being's eyes become windows to their mind, showing you a vision of their thoughts. For the duration, you can read the thoughts of a being you can see within range, as soon as eye contact can be made. After the spell effects begin, eye contact does not need to be maintained.

You initially learn the surface thoughts of the being - what is most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can attempt to probe deeper into its mind. If you probe deeper, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain insight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and something that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries over, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. You can probe deeper a second time, forcefully pulling memories from the being's mind if it fails the second Wisdom saving throw.

Questions verbally directed at the target naturally shape the course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective as part of an interrogation. If you cast the spell verbally and the target can hear you, it knows you are probing into its mind and the creature can use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check contested by your Intelligence check. If it succeeds, the spell ends.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the DC of the Wisdom saving throws increases by 1 for each slot level above 3rd.
#### [Levicorpus/Liberacorpus](#spell-list)

*The Dangling Jinx - 4th-level Curse*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 1 minute
___
One of the few spells that are a non-verbal spell by design, this jinx yanks a being's feet out from under it and dangles it in the air, hanging by its ankle. This spell always is cast with the effects of the Subtle Spell metamagic, at no sorcery point cost and whether you have Subtle Spell or not.

A creature you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw or take 3d10 psychic damage and be restrained. Additionally, if the target tries to cast a spell, it must first succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or the casting fails and the spell is wasted.
#### [Locomotor](#spell-list)
<span id="spell-descr-Locomotor"></span>
*The Locomotion Charm - 1st-level Charm (ritual)*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** 1 hour
___
One object that isn't being worn or carried of your choice that you can see within range rises 3 feet off the ground, and remains suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. If more weight than the limit is placed on top of the object, the spell ends, and it falls to the ground.

The object is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the object follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the object can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

If you move more than 100 feet from the object (typically because it can't move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.

___
One willing, paralyzed, petrified, restrained, stunned or unconscious being of your choice that you can see within range rises 3 feet off the ground, and remains suspended there for the duration as if it were hoisted by invisible ropes under its arms. The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. If more weight than the limit is placed on top of the being, the spell ends, and it falls to the ground.

The being is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move more than 20 feet away from it, the being follows you so that it remains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up or down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can't cross an elevation change of 10 feet or more. For example, the being can't move across a 10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at the bottom.

- **Casting Time:** 10 minutes
- **Range:** Self (60-foot-radius sphere)
- **Duration:** 8 hours
- **Tags:** Defensive, School of Magic - *Jinxes, Hexes, and Curses*
___
Commonly used by the Department of Magical Law enforcement, this wards an area against apparition or disapparition. No one may arrive in the warded area via *apparition*, nor may any creatures within the warded area cast the spell. Any attempt to do so results in the typical *apparition* effect, except the creature stays exactly where they are.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 60 feet for each slot level above 5th.
#### [Obliviate](#spell-list)
<span id="spell-descr-Obliviate"></span>
*The Memory Charm - 5th-level Charm*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Tags:** School of Magic - *Charms*
___
You attempt to reshape another being's memories. One being you can see within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target's memories are modified.

You can eliminate the target's memory of an event or detail (or any individual aspect of that event or detail) that it experienced or perceived within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes.

You must mentally describe or visualize how the memories are affected. The being's mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing or visualizing the modified memories, the targetâs memory isnât altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.

A modified memory doesn't necessarily affect how a being behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature's natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as erasing all memory of how they were transported to and from a location, is dismissed by the target, perhaps as a bad dream. The HM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a being in a significant manner.

A *vulnera sanentur* or *obliviate* spell cast on the target restores the creature's true memory.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can eliminate the target's memories of an event that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature's past (9th level). Alternatively, you can eliminate a detail or topic in all memories across those same time frames.

___
You cast this jinx on a group of tiny objects or a group of birds within range. The targets start swarming in the air in a 5-foot-diameter sphere in an unoccupied space of your choice. Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the swarm or enters the swarmâs area for the first time on a turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 4d4 slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. While the swarm shares the same space with a creature, that creature has disadvantage on attack rolls. The swarm's space counts as difficult terrain.

___
You choose a space on the ground that is currently occupied by a Large or smaller creature you can see within range. The ground becomes a thick liquid and swirls out from under the creature in an orb-like shape. The material then slams back down and regains its solidity in an attempt to partially bury the creature. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage and is restrained for the spellâs duration.

As an action, you can cause the earth to crush the restrained target, who must make a Strength saving throw. It takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

To break out, the restrained target can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, the target pulls its legs free and is no longer restrained.

This unique charm redirects magical effects to create an opening. On any area spell of 3rd level or lower that forms a line, wall, or perimeter, an opening appears in the spell's effect at a point of your choice that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. You choose the openingâs dimensions: up to 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall. For a spell of 4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spellâs level. On a successful check, the opening is created. The opening can be dispelled at will.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, you automatically create an opening in the spell if the spell's level is one level higher than, equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used.

___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action

- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute
- **Tags:** School of Magic - *Charms*
___
Objects come to life at your command. Choose up to five nonmagical objects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium targets count as one object, Large targets count as two objects, Huge targets count as four objects. You can't animate any object larger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under your control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.

As a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made with this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide what action the creature will take and where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is complete.
##### Animated Object Statistics
| Size   | HP | AC | Attack                     | Str | Dex |
|:-------|:--:|:--:|:---------------------------|:---:|:---:|
| Medium | 40 | 13 | +5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage  | 10  | 12  |
| Large  | 50 | 10 | +6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage | 14  | 10  |
| Huge   | 80 | 10 | +8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage | 18  | 6   |

An animated object is a construct with AC, hit points, attacks, Strength, and Dexterity determine by its size. Its Constitution is 10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its speed is 30 feet, if the Objects lack legs or other appendages it can use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and can hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or larger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It has blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that distance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.

If you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee attack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam attack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determine by its size. The HM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or piercing damage based on its form.

***At Higher Levels.*** If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, you can animate one additional object for each slot level above 5th.

An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration. 

Any attack or spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier canât affect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above 6th.

This spell forces both living and inanimate targets to release their grip. Choose an object or creature that you can see within range.

On a failed save, it must let go of whatever it is restraining. This effect ends any grappled or restrained condition that is being imposed by the target.

An object that is secured by a mundane or magical lock or that is stuck becomes unlocked, unstuck, or unbarred. When you cast the spell on an object, a loud rattling or clanking, audible from as far away as 100 feet, emanates from the target object.

A creature is not forced to drop any object that it is holding. The creature must be restraining the object in some way, like holding onto an object that has had *accio* cast upon it.

___
Frequently used around wizarding areas, this charm keeps Muggles away from dangerous situations or overtly magical locations. You enchant an area to suggest a course of activity and magically influence a non-magical human. Upon entering the warded area, the subject must make a Wisdom saving throw at disadvantage. On a failed save, it pursues a course of action that takes it away from the area of the spell.

The subject's mind naturally thinks of the best reason to convince itself that it must depart, or barring an actual reason, invents an arbitrary emergency that demands its attention elsewhere. The spell's effect ends when the subject has either attended to the matter they thought of or when the subject has decided to take another course of action that does not involve entering the area of the spell.

The spell can levitate a target that weighs up to 100 pounds. An unwilling creature that succeeds on a Constitution saving throw is unaffected.

The target can move only by pushing or pulling against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as a wall or a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were climbing. You can change the targetâs altitude by up to 20 feet in either direction on your turn. Otherwise, you can use your action to move the target, which must remain within the spellâs range.

If the spell is ended voluntarily, the target floats gently to the ground if it is still aloft. If ended involuntarily, the target immediately drops.

***At Higher Levels.*** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, the weight limit is increased by 150 pounds for each slot level above 0.

# Appendix A: Potion Brewing
Potions are an essential part of wizarding life, especially in the halls of St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. Although Potions is a core class for young witches and wizards during their years at Hogwarts, it's not everyone's cup of tea. Brewing your own potions is not required. It's an optional pursuit Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â for the wizards who are so inclined.
## Brewing Requirements
Potion brewing does not require any dice rolls and therefore does not require HM supervision. If the requirements are fulfilled, a PC can brew a potion in the background while other players are playing or while the player is away from the table. After a potion is brewed, the HM will confirm the proper recipe was used and assess the ingredient quality. Aside from the few potions with time restrictions, all you need to instantly brew a potion is:
* Access to a properly equipped potions laboratory
* A potioneer's kit in your possession
* Knowledge of the potion's recipe
* The ingredients specified in the recipe

A potions laboratory must be equipped with a cauldron, stirring rods, a source of heat, and a source of water. All Hogwarts students have access to the Potions classroom, but extracurricular use may require permission from the Potions Master. This is the only potions laboratory available to the average Hogwarts student, but adult wizards may be able to equip their own private laboratory or set up a more portable arrangement for their travels. 

A potioneer's kit is included in the Hogwarts shopping list, so every student should have one. It includes a set of brass scales, silver knife, cutting board, mortar and pestle, measuring cups, eye dropper and vials, jars and flasks, as well as some staple ingredients that aren't included in recipes. This will last a typical student's time at Hogwarts, but the avid amateur may require replacements or upgrades.

\columnbreak
## Learning Recipes
Approximately half of all recipes are learned in the standard Hogwarts curriculum. At the beginning of every school year, the new Potions textbook includes five potion recipes. If a student wants to learn additional recipes, they must search the Hogwarts library in their spare time, seek more advanced potioneers to tutor them and go on adventures to prove themselves worthy of ancient knowledge.

Alternatively, if a brewed potion is acquired, an aspiring potioneer can attempt to deconstruct that potion. This requires a potions laboratory, a potioneer's kit, casting *specialis revelio* and a Wisdom (Potion-Making) ability check. The potion is destroyed by this process, but if the check is successful, the potioneer learns the potion's recipe.

## Obtaining Ingredients
In a dim clearing of the Forbidden Forest, the private supplies of a trusted ally or the dusty shelves of an apothecary, you're going to find many magical and mundane essences that can be used as potion ingredients. Because of the magical applications of these potions and the danger in harvesting, potion ingredients are extremely valuable.

Different tools will be required to harvest different kinds of ingredients. As a general rule, plant-based ingredients will require the use of herbologist's tools, while harvesting ingredients from animals and magical beasts will use the potioneer's kit. Your own skill with these tools will determine the quality of the obtained ingredient. Doing a rough job at harvesting will produce Poor ingredients, while skilled work will produce Superior ingredients.

## Potion Effectiveness
A potion's effectiveness is dependent on the brewer's technical skill and the preparation of the ingredients. Proficiency in Wisdom (Potion-Making) and proficiency with the potioneer's kit are not necessary, but those proficiencies will improve the effectiveness of your potions. Skill can often help a brewer overcome the limitations of Poor ingredients, but truly Exceptional potions require Superior ingredients.

# Appendix B: Patronus Rolling Tables
Your character's corporeal patronus can be determined several different ways. First, you can simply choose your patronus. Its form makes no significant mechanical impact on the *expecto patronum* spell. The second method is getting a random result by rolling on the d100 table below. 

The last method provides customized rolling tables with options based on your character's personality. Find your character's Background on the subsequent pages. Then, locate your House under that Background and use that rolling table to determine your corporeal patronus. If your character is not a Hogwarts student, choose a house based on your character's personality and values.

# Glossary
## A
### Alchemy
A medieval forerunner of chemistry, alchemy was developed out of experiments to find a method of turning base metals into gold, and of making an elixir of life that would prolong life indefinitely. A very advanced and complex topic that requires in-depth knowledge about the nature of magic and the four basic elements: earth, air, fire, and water.
### Apparate
To apparate is to magically teleport a limited distance, creating a loud crack or pop whenever used. Apparition requires a licence from the Department of Magical Transportation, which can only be issued to those seventeen and over. Disapparition is the word to describe when a person disappears, leaving by apparating. 
### Arithmancy
Ancient study of the magical properties of numbers. Arithmancy is often needed in the modification or creation of spells, a very dangerous practice.
### Auror
Professional Dark wizard catcher and the equivalent to a Muggle detective or special agent. To become an Auror, a witch or wizard must gain at least five N.E.W.T.s with grades no lower than 'Exceeds Expectations' in subjects including: Defence Against the Dark Arts, Potions, Transfiguration, and Charms; pass stringent character and aptitude tests at the Ministry of Magic's Auror office, then do three years of Auror training.
### Azkaban
Island prison fortress where wizarding criminals are sent. Guarded day and night by the terrifying Dementors, who drain peace, hope and happiness out of any human in their vicinity.
## B
### Basilisk
A Dark creature much like a gargantuan, heavy-bodied snake, measuring up to 50 feet in length when fully grown. Unlike a snake, a basilisk has a full row of fangs, all of which contain the most deadly venom for which there is no antidote. Its yellow eyes will kill any creature that looks directly into them, and petrify (frozen in time, as if turned to stone) anyone who catches an indirect glimpse.

\columnbreak
### Beauxbatons Academy of Magic (AcadÃ©mie de Magie BeauxbÃ¢tons)
A co-ed wizarding school located somewhere in France, often seen as comparable to Hogwarts in quality of education.
### Broomstick
One of the most popular forms of wizarding transportation, broomsticks have been bewitched with countless enchantments to facilitate flight, such as a cushioning charm to sit upon, braking charms, and anti-jinx protections. A broomstick is controlled by the rider's grip on the handle, accelerating when squeezed.
### Butterbeer
A frothy butterscotch-flavored drink served hot or cold, depending on the weather. Has diminutive alcoholic content, but that has a severe effect on house-elves.
## C
### Construct
Not a magically animated robot, but rather simply a "living" creature that has been transfigured or conjured into existence. If a rock was transfigured into a dog to distract a dragon, that dog is a construct, meaning it's a materialization of the wizard's concept of a dog. It behaves how the wizard expects a dog to behave. It is an imitation of life and will eventually return to being a rock.
## D
### The Daily Prophet
The most popular wizarding newspaper in Great Britain.
## E
### Elves
See house-elf.
### Exploding Snap
The wizarding version of the muggle card game of snap, which uses a specifically-enchanted deck that may explode at any time.

## F
### Floo Powder
Glittering silver powder that allows witches and wizards to travel magically via the Floo Network by throwing the powder into a lit fireplace, stepping into the green flames, and naming their destination. A wizard may also kneel with their head in the green fire to merely communicate with whomever is near the destination fireplace. The Floo Network is managed by the Floo Network Authority under the Department of Magical Transportation, and connects wizarding fireplaces to each other.
## G
### Ghoul
A magical beast that resembles a slimy, buck-toothed ogre. They tend to live in the attics or barns of wizards and witches. They are relatively harmless creatures and are just seen as nuisances because of the noise they make. They are relatively dimwitted, and live off of bugs and other household pests. At most, they will groan and throw objects.
### Giant
Huge humanoid beings with extremely violent and tribalistic tendencies, growing up to 25 feet tall. Although they are intelligent and capable of interacting with other beings (sometimes resulting in part-giants), they almost invariable lose patience and resort to violence.
### Gnomes
Very small creatures with leathery skin and large, bald heads like knobbly potatoes. They have horny feet and razor-sharp teeth. They live in holes in gardens and aren't very bright. To de-gnome a garden, grab the gnome by the ankles, swing it in circles until it's dizzy, and throw it as far as you can.
### Goblins
Small clever beings with swarthy faces and very long hands and feet, showing some traits of the dwarves of Muggle fiction. Goblins own Gringotts Bank and are responsible for minting wizarding currencies, as well as various metalworks. They have a deep distrust of wizards due to centuries of goblin-wizard conflicts and uprisings. Wizards have historically oppressed goblins and denied them use of wands.
### Gobstones
The wizarding version of marbles. The pieces squirt a stinky substance into other players' faces when they lose a point.
## H
### Half-breed
A perjorative term used against humans with non-human ancestry or particular magical curses, like lycanthropy. Never used in civil conversation.

\columnbreak
### HM
HM stands for Headmaster or Headmistress, which typically refers to the witch or wizard in charge of Hogwarts. In the context of Wands & Wizards, the HM is the master of the table and runs the game.
### House-elf
A very small creature dedicated to manual labor and indentured to a specific wizarding family. House-elves are freed by
### Howler
Wizarding letter which, when opened, shrieks and howls at the reader in the deafening voice of the sender. Comes in a red envelope and is usually sent by someone who is very angry.
## M
### Mudblood
Highly offensive and derogatory term for a muggle-born wizard or witch. Only used by blood purists, who believe that those with ancestry of magical blood are superior.
### Muggle duelling
A non-magical physical fight.
## N
### N.E.W.T.s
Nastily Exhausting Wizarding Tests. Higher level examinations taken at the end of the seventh year at Hogwarts.
## O
### O.W.L.s
Ordinary Wizarding Levels. Hogwarts standard-level examinations which are taken at the end of the fifth year.
## P
### Pensieve
Stone basin which enables one to view thoughts and memories, pulled out from one's mind using a wand.
### Poltergeist
A humanoid spirit born entirely from mischevious energy. Unlike ghosts, a poltergeist never had a life, has color, and can turn itself invisible.
<div class='footnote'>Glossary</div>

\pagebreakNum
### Portkey
Any object can be bewitched for use as a portkey to teleport witches and wizards away to a prearranged destination the instant they touch it or at a scheduled time. Physical contact must be made to use a portkey. Use of a portkey should be authorised by the Ministry of Magic.
## R
### Remembrall
Magical glass ball, the size of a large marble, filled with white smoke. The smoke turns to a deep red if there is something you have forgotten to do.
## S
### Sorcerer
Non-gendered term for a witch or a wizard. 
### Squib
Someone who, despite being born into a wizarding family, has little or no magical ability. Anti-muggle magic typically doesn't affect them, and they are able to see Dementors. Squibs are often looked down upon and find themselves as rejects trapped in the wizarding world.
## U
### Unicorn
Mythical white horse-like creature with a golden mane and a golden horn sprouting from the head. Innocent and beautiful creatures. The tail hair and horn can be used in magic. It is considered a monstrous crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking its blood will keep you alive, even when close to death. However, you have killed something pure, and will therefore live a half, cursed life.
### Unspeakable
Employee of the Ministry of Magic's Department of Mysteries. Little is known about their workplace, and even less is known about their jobs. They are forbidden from discussing their jobs or disclosing any information about their department, hence the name "Unspeakable."
## W
### Warlock
A very old term that has two meanings: to describe a wizard of unusually fierce appearance or as a title denoting particular skill or achievement. It originally denoted one learned in duelling and all martial magic or was given as a title to a wizard who had performed feats of bravery (as Muggles are sometimes knighted). It is sometimes incorrectly used as interchangeable with the term "wizard."
